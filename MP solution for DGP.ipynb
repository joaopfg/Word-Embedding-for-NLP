I lived there two years and two months. At present\\r\\nI am a sojourner in civilized life again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very\\r\\nparticular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of\\r\\nlife, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all\\r\\nimpertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent.\\r\\nSome have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not\\r\\nafraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my\\r\\nincome I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how\\r\\nmany poor children I maintained. I will therefore ask those of my readers who\\r\\nfeel no particular interest in me to pardon me if I undertake to answer some of\\r\\nthese questions in this book. In most books, the I, or first person, is\\r\\nomitted; in this it will be retained; that, in respect to egotism, is the main\\r\\ndifference. We commonly do not remember that it is, after all, always the first\\r\\nperson that is speaking. I should not talk so much about myself if there were\\r\\nanybody else whom I knew as well. Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by\\r\\nthe narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every\\r\\nwriter, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not\\r\\nmerely what he has heard of other men’s lives; some such account as he\\r\\nwould send to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely,\\r\\nit must have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more\\r\\nparticularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers, they\\r\\nwill accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will stretch the\\r\\nseams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI would fain say something, not so much concerning the Chinese and Sandwich\\r\\nIslanders as you who read these pages, who are said to live in New England;\\r\\nsomething about your condition, especially your outward condition or\\r\\ncircumstances in this world, in this town, what it is, whether it is necessary\\r\\nthat it be as bad as it is, whether it cannot be improved as well as not. I\\r\\nhave travelled a good deal in Concord; and everywhere, in shops, and offices,\\r\\nand fields, the inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance in a\\r\\nthousand remarkable ways. What I have heard of Brahmins sitting exposed to four\\r\\nfires and looking in the face of the sun; or hanging suspended, with their\\r\\nheads downward, over flames; or looking at the heavens over their shoulders\\r\\n“until it becomes impossible for them to resume their natural position,\\r\\nwhile from the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the\\r\\nstomach;” or dwelling, chained for life, at the foot of a tree; or\\r\\nmeasuring with their bodies, like caterpillars, the breadth of vast empires; or\\r\\nstanding on one leg on the tops of pillars,—even these forms of conscious\\r\\npenance are hardly more incredible and astonishing than the scenes which I\\r\\ndaily witness. The twelve labors of Hercules were trifling in comparison with\\r\\nthose which my neighbors have undertaken; for they were only twelve, and had an\\r\\nend; but I could never see that these men slew or captured any monster or\\r\\nfinished any labor. They have no friend Iolas to burn with a hot iron the root\\r\\nof the hydra’s head, but as soon as one head is crushed, two spring up.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms,\\r\\nhouses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired\\r\\nthan got rid of. Better if they had been born in the open pasture and suckled\\r\\nby a wolf, that they might have seen with clearer eyes what field they were\\r\\ncalled to labor in. Who made them serfs of the soil? Why should they eat their\\r\\nsixty acres, when man is condemned to eat only his peck of dirt? Why should\\r\\nthey begin digging their graves as soon as they are born? They have got to live\\r\\na man’s life, pushing all these things before them, and get on as well as\\r\\nthey can. How many a poor immortal soul have I met well nigh crushed and\\r\\nsmothered under its load, creeping down the road of life, pushing before it a\\r\\nbarn seventy-five feet by forty, its Augean stables never cleansed, and one\\r\\nhundred acres of land, tillage, mowing, pasture, and wood-lot! The portionless,\\r\\nwho struggle with no such unnecessary inherited encumbrances, find it labor\\r\\nenough to subdue and cultivate a few cubic feet of flesh.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into\\r\\nthe soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are\\r\\nemployed, as it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust\\r\\nwill corrupt and thieves break through and steal. It is a fool’s life, as\\r\\nthey will find when they get to the end of it, if not before. It is said that\\r\\nDeucalion and Pyrrha created men by throwing stones over their heads behind\\r\\nthem:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nInde genus durum sumus, experiensque laborum,\\r\\nEt documenta damus quÃ¢ simus origine nati.\\n\\n\\r\\nOr, as Raleigh rhymes it in his sonorous way,—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“From thence our kind hard-hearted is, enduring pain and care,\\r\\nApproving that our bodies of a stony nature are.”\\n\\n\\r\\nSo much for a blind obedience to a blundering oracle, throwing the stones over\\r\\ntheir heads behind them, and not seeing where they fell.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMost men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and\\r\\nmistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse\\r\\nlabors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them. Their fingers,\\r\\nfrom excessive toil, are too clumsy and tremble too much for that. Actually,\\r\\nthe laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day; he cannot\\r\\nafford to sustain the manliest relations to men; his labor would be depreciated\\r\\nin the market. He has no time to be anything but a machine. How can he remember\\r\\nwell his ignorance—which his growth requires—who has so often to\\r\\nuse his knowledge? We should feed and clothe him gratuitously sometimes, and\\r\\nrecruit him with our cordials, before we judge of him. The finest qualities of\\r\\nour nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved only by the most\\r\\ndelicate handling. Yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSome of you, we all know, are poor, find it hard to live, are sometimes, as it\\r\\nwere, gasping for breath. I have no doubt that some of you who read this book\\r\\nare unable to pay for all the dinners which you have actually eaten, or for the\\r\\ncoats and shoes which are fast wearing or are already worn out, and have come\\r\\nto this page to spend borrowed or stolen time, robbing your creditors of an\\r\\nhour. It is very evident what mean and sneaking lives many of you live, for my\\r\\nsight has been whetted by experience; always on the limits, trying to get into\\r\\nbusiness and trying to get out of debt, a very ancient slough, called by the\\r\\nLatins Ã¦s alienum, another’s brass, for some of their coins were\\r\\nmade of brass; still living, and dying, and buried by this other’s brass;\\r\\nalways promising to pay, promising to pay, tomorrow, and dying today,\\r\\ninsolvent; seeking to curry favor, to get custom, by how many modes, only not\\r\\nstate-prison offences; lying, flattering, voting, contracting yourselves into a\\r\\nnutshell of civility or dilating into an atmosphere of thin and vaporous\\r\\ngenerosity, that you may persuade your neighbor to let you make his shoes, or\\r\\nhis hat, or his coat, or his carriage, or import his groceries for him; making\\r\\nyourselves sick, that you may lay up something against a sick day, something to\\r\\nbe tucked away in an old chest, or in a stocking behind the plastering, or,\\r\\nmore safely, in the brick bank; no matter where, no matter how much or how\\r\\nlittle.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous, I may almost say, as to attend\\r\\nto the gross but somewhat foreign form of servitude called Negro Slavery, there\\r\\nare so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both north and south. It is\\r\\nhard to have a southern overseer; it is worse to have a northern one; but worst\\r\\nof all when you are the slave-driver of yourself. Talk of a divinity in man!\\r\\nLook at the teamster on the highway, wending to market by day or night; does\\r\\nany divinity stir within him? His highest duty to fodder and water his horses!\\r\\nWhat is his destiny to him compared with the shipping interests? Does not he\\r\\ndrive for Squire Make-a-stir? How godlike, how immortal, is he? See how he\\r\\ncowers and sneaks, how vaguely all the day he fears, not being immortal nor\\r\\ndivine, but the slave and prisoner of his own opinion of himself, a fame won by\\r\\nhis own deeds. Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private\\r\\nopinion. What a man thinks of himself, that it is which determines, or rather\\r\\nindicates, his fate. Self-emancipation even in the West Indian provinces of the\\r\\nfancy and imagination,—what Wilberforce is there to bring that about?\\r\\nThink, also, of the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against the last\\r\\nday, not to betray too green an interest in their fates! As if you could kill\\r\\ntime without injuring eternity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is\\r\\nconfirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate\\r\\ncountry, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A\\r\\nstereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the\\r\\ngames and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after\\r\\nwork. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen we consider what, to use the words of the catechism, is the chief end of\\r\\nman, and what are the true necessaries and means of life, it appears as if men\\r\\nhad deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to\\r\\nany other. Yet they honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and\\r\\nhealthy natures remember that the sun rose clear. It is never too late to give\\r\\nup our prejudices. No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted\\r\\nwithout proof. What everybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may\\r\\nturn out to be falsehood to-morrow, mere smoke of opinion, which some had\\r\\ntrusted for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields. What\\r\\nold people say you cannot do you try and find that you can. Old deeds for old\\r\\npeople, and new deeds for new. Old people did not know enough once, perchance,\\r\\nto fetch fresh fuel to keep the fire a-going; new people put a little dry wood\\r\\nunder a pot, and are whirled round the globe with the speed of birds, in a way\\r\\nto kill old people, as the phrase is. Age is no better, hardly so well,\\r\\nqualified for an instructor as youth, for it has not profited so much as it has\\r\\nlost. One may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned any thing of absolute\\r\\nvalue by living. Practically, the old have no very important advice to give the\\r\\nyoung, their own experience has been so partial, and their lives have been such\\r\\nmiserable failures, for private reasons, as they must believe; and it may be\\r\\nthat they have some faith left which belies that experience, and they are only\\r\\nless young than they were. I have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I\\r\\nhave yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my\\r\\nseniors. They have told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me any thing to the\\r\\npurpose. Here is life, an experiment to a great extent untried by me; but it\\r\\ndoes not avail me that they have tried it. If I have any experience which I\\r\\nthink valuable, I am sure to reflect that this my Mentors said nothing about.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne farmer says to me, “You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it\\r\\nfurnishes nothing to make bones with;” and so he religiously devotes a\\r\\npart of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones; walking\\r\\nall the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk\\r\\nhim and his lumbering plough along in spite of every obstacle. Some things are\\r\\nreally necessaries of life in some circles, the most helpless and diseased,\\r\\nwhich in others are luxuries merely, and in others still are entirely unknown.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe whole ground of human life seems to some to have been gone over by their\\r\\npredecessors, both the heights and the valleys, and all things to have been\\r\\ncared for. According to Evelyn, “the wise Solomon prescribed ordinances\\r\\nfor the very distances of trees; and the Roman prÃ¦tors have decided how\\r\\noften you may go into your neighbor’s land to gather the acorns which\\r\\nfall on it without trespass, and what share belongs to that neighbor.”\\r\\nHippocrates has even left directions how we should cut our nails; that is, even\\r\\nwith the ends of the fingers, neither shorter nor longer. Undoubtedly the very\\r\\ntedium and ennui which presume to have exhausted the variety and the joys of\\r\\nlife are as old as Adam. But man’s capacities have never been measured;\\r\\nnor are we to judge of what he can do by any precedents, so little has been\\r\\ntried. Whatever have been thy failures hitherto, “be not afflicted, my\\r\\nchild, for who shall assign to thee what thou hast left undone?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe might try our lives by a thousand simple tests; as, for instance, that the\\r\\nsame sun which ripens my beans illumines at once a system of earths like ours.\\r\\nIf I had remembered this it would have prevented some mistakes. This was not\\r\\nthe light in which I hoed them. The stars are the apexes of what wonderful\\r\\ntriangles! What distant and different beings in the various mansions of the\\r\\nuniverse are contemplating the same one at the same moment! Nature and human\\r\\nlife are as various as our several constitutions. Who shall say what prospect\\r\\nlife offers to another? Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look\\r\\nthrough each other’s eyes for an instant? We should live in all the ages\\r\\nof the world in an hour; ay, in all the worlds of the ages. History, Poetry,\\r\\nMythology!—I know of no reading of another’s experience so\\r\\nstartling and informing as this would be.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe greater part of what my neighbors call good I believe in my soul to be bad,\\r\\nand if I repent of anything, it is very likely to be my good behavior. What\\r\\ndemon possessed me that I behaved so well? You may say the wisest thing you\\r\\ncan, old man,—you who have lived seventy years, not without honor of a\\r\\nkind,—I hear an irresistible voice which invites me away from all that.\\r\\nOne generation abandons the enterprises of another like stranded vessels.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI think that we may safely trust a good deal more than we do. We may waive just\\r\\nso much care of ourselves as we honestly bestow elsewhere. Nature is as well\\r\\nadapted to our weakness as to our strength. The incessant anxiety and strain of\\r\\nsome is a well nigh incurable form of disease. We are made to exaggerate the\\r\\nimportance of what work we do; and yet how much is not done by us! or, what if\\r\\nwe had been taken sick? How vigilant we are! determined not to live by faith if\\r\\nwe can avoid it; all the day long on the alert, at night we unwillingly say our\\r\\nprayers and commit ourselves to uncertainties. So thoroughly and sincerely are\\r\\nwe compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying the possibility of\\r\\nchange. This is the only way, we say; but there are as many ways as there can\\r\\nbe drawn radii from one centre. All change is a miracle to contemplate; but it\\r\\nis a miracle which is taking place every instant. Confucius said, “To\\r\\nknow that we know what we know, and that we do not know what we do not know,\\r\\nthat is true knowledge.” When one man has reduced a fact of the\\r\\nimagination to be a fact to his understanding, I foresee that all men at length\\r\\nestablish their lives on that basis.\\n\\n\\r\\nLet us consider for a moment what most of the trouble and anxiety which I have\\r\\nreferred to is about, and how much it is necessary that we be troubled, or, at\\r\\nleast, careful. It would be some advantage to live a primitive and frontier\\r\\nlife, though in the midst of an outward civilization, if only to learn what are\\r\\nthe gross necessaries of life and what methods have been taken to obtain them;\\r\\nor even to look over the old day-books of the merchants, to see what it was\\r\\nthat men most commonly bought at the stores, what they stored, that is, what\\r\\nare the grossest groceries. For the improvements of ages have had but little\\r\\ninfluence on the essential laws of man’s existence; as our skeletons,\\r\\nprobably, are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy the words, necessary of life, I mean whatever, of all that man\\r\\nobtains by his own exertions, has been from the first, or from long use has\\r\\nbecome, so important to human life that few, if any, whether from savageness,\\r\\nor poverty, or philosophy, ever attempt to do without it. To many creatures\\r\\nthere is in this sense but one necessary of life, Food. To the bison of the\\r\\nprairie it is a few inches of palatable grass, with water to drink; unless he\\r\\nseeks the Shelter of the forest or the mountain’s shadow. None of the\\r\\nbrute creation requires more than Food and Shelter. The necessaries of life for\\r\\nman in this climate may, accurately enough, be distributed under the several\\r\\nheads of Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel; for not till we have secured these\\r\\nare we prepared to entertain the true problems of life with freedom and a\\r\\nprospect of success. Man has invented, not only houses, but clothes and cooked\\r\\nfood; and possibly from the accidental discovery of the warmth of fire, and the\\r\\nconsequent use of it, at first a luxury, arose the present necessity to sit by\\r\\nit. We observe cats and dogs acquiring the same second nature. By proper\\r\\nShelter and Clothing we legitimately retain our own internal heat; but with an\\r\\nexcess of these, or of Fuel, that is, with an external heat greater than our\\r\\nown internal, may not cookery properly be said to begin? Darwin, the\\r\\nnaturalist, says of the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, that while his own\\r\\nparty, who were well clothed and sitting close to a fire, were far from too\\r\\nwarm, these naked savages, who were farther off, were observed, to his great\\r\\nsurprise, “to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a\\r\\nroasting.” So, we are told, the New Hollander goes naked with impunity,\\r\\nwhile the European shivers in his clothes. Is it impossible to combine the\\r\\nhardiness of these savages with the intellectualness of the civilized man?\\r\\nAccording to Liebig, man’s body is a stove, and food the fuel which keeps\\r\\nup the internal combustion in the lungs. In cold weather we eat more, in warm\\r\\nless. The animal heat is the result of a slow combustion, and disease and death\\r\\ntake place when this is too rapid; or for want of fuel, or from some defect in\\r\\nthe draught, the fire goes out. Of course the vital heat is not to be\\r\\nconfounded with fire; but so much for analogy. It appears, therefore, from the\\r\\nabove list, that the expression, animal life, is nearly synonymous with\\r\\nthe expression, animal heat; for while Food may be regarded as the Fuel\\r\\nwhich keeps up the fire within us,—and Fuel serves only to prepare that\\r\\nFood or to increase the warmth of our bodies by addition from\\r\\nwithout,—Shelter and Clothing also serve only to retain the heat\\r\\nthus generated and absorbed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe grand necessity, then, for our bodies, is to keep warm, to keep the vital\\r\\nheat in us. What pains we accordingly take, not only with our Food, and\\r\\nClothing, and Shelter, but with our beds, which are our night-clothes, robbing\\r\\nthe nests and breasts of birds to prepare this shelter within a shelter, as the\\r\\nmole has its bed of grass and leaves at the end of its burrow! The poor man is\\r\\nwont to complain that this is a cold world; and to cold, no less physical than\\r\\nsocial, we refer directly a great part of our ails. The summer, in some\\r\\nclimates, makes possible to man a sort of Elysian life. Fuel, except to cook\\r\\nhis Food, is then unnecessary; the sun is his fire, and many of the fruits are\\r\\nsufficiently cooked by its rays; while Food generally is more various, and more\\r\\neasily obtained, and Clothing and Shelter are wholly or half unnecessary. At\\r\\nthe present day, and in this country, as I find by my own experience, a few\\r\\nimplements, a knife, an axe, a spade, a wheelbarrow, &c., and for the\\r\\nstudious, lamplight, stationery, and access to a few books, rank next to\\r\\nnecessaries, and can all be obtained at a trifling cost. Yet some, not wise, go\\r\\nto the other side of the globe, to barbarous and unhealthy regions, and devote\\r\\nthemselves to trade for ten or twenty years, in order that they may\\r\\nlive,—that is, keep comfortably warm,—and die in New England at last.\\r\\nThe luxuriously rich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally hot;\\r\\nas I implied before, they are cooked, of course Ã\\xa0 la mode.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMost of the luxuries, and many of the so called comforts of life, are not only\\r\\nnot indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With\\r\\nrespect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and\\r\\nmeagre life than the poor. The ancient philosophers, Chinese, Hindoo, Persian,\\r\\nand Greek, were a class than which none has been poorer in outward riches, none\\r\\nso rich in inward. We know not much about them. It is remarkable that we\\r\\nknow so much of them as we do. The same is true of the more modern reformers\\r\\nand benefactors of their race. None can be an impartial or wise observer of\\r\\nhuman life but from the vantage ground of what we should call voluntary\\r\\npoverty. Of a life of luxury the fruit is luxury, whether in agriculture, or\\r\\ncommerce, or literature, or art. There are nowadays professors of philosophy,\\r\\nbut not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once\\r\\nadmirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts,\\r\\nnor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its\\r\\ndictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to\\r\\nsolve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically.\\r\\nThe success of great scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtier-like success,\\r\\nnot kingly, not manly. They make shift to live merely by conformity,\\r\\npractically as their fathers did, and are in no sense the progenitors of a\\r\\nnobler race of men. But why do men degenerate ever? What makes families run out?\\r\\nWhat is the nature of the luxury which enervates and destroys nations? Are we\\r\\nsure that there is none of it in our own lives? The philosopher is in advance\\r\\nof his age even in the outward form of his life. He is not fed, sheltered,\\r\\nclothed, warmed, like his contemporaries. How can a man be a philosopher and\\r\\nnot maintain his vital heat by better methods than other men?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen a man is warmed by the several modes which I have described, what does he\\r\\nwant next? Surely not more warmth of the same kind, as more and richer food,\\r\\nlarger and more splendid houses, finer and more abundant clothing, more\\r\\nnumerous incessant and hotter fires, and the like. When he has obtained those\\r\\nthings which are necessary to life, there is another alternative than to obtain\\r\\nthe superfluities; and that is, to adventure on life now, his vacation from\\r\\nhumbler toil having commenced. The soil, it appears, is suited to the seed, for\\r\\nit has sent its radicle downward, and it may now send its shoot upward also\\r\\nwith confidence. Why has man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth, but that\\r\\nhe may rise in the same proportion into the heavens above?—for the nobler\\r\\nplants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the air and light, far\\r\\nfrom the ground, and are not treated like the humbler esculents, which, though\\r\\nthey may be biennials, are cultivated only till they have perfected their root,\\r\\nand often cut down at top for this purpose, so that most would not know them in\\r\\ntheir flowering season.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI do not mean to prescribe rules to strong and valiant natures, who will mind\\r\\ntheir own affairs whether in heaven or hell, and perchance build more\\r\\nmagnificently and spend more lavishly than the richest, without ever\\r\\nimpoverishing themselves, not knowing how they live,—if, indeed, there are\\r\\nany such, as has been dreamed; nor to those who find their encouragement and\\r\\ninspiration in precisely the present condition of things, and cherish it with\\r\\nthe fondness and enthusiasm of lovers,—and, to some extent, I reckon\\r\\nmyself in this number; I do not speak to those who are well employed, in\\r\\nwhatever circumstances, and they know whether they are well employed or\\r\\nnot;—but mainly to the mass of men who are discontented, and idly\\r\\ncomplaining of the hardness of their lot or of the times, when they might\\r\\nimprove them. There are some who complain most energetically and inconsolably\\r\\nof any, because they are, as they say, doing their duty. I also have in my mind\\r\\nthat seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who have\\r\\naccumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have\\r\\nforged their own golden or silver fetters.\\n\\n\\r\\nIf I should attempt to tell how I have desired to spend my life in years past,\\r\\nit would probably surprise those of my readers who are somewhat acquainted with\\r\\nits actual history; it would certainly astonish those who know nothing about\\r\\nit. I will only hint at some of the enterprises which I have cherished.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to improve\\r\\nthe nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the meeting of two\\r\\neternities, the past and future, which is precisely the present moment; to toe\\r\\nthat line. You will pardon some obscurities, for there are more secrets in my\\r\\ntrade than in most men’s, and yet not voluntarily kept, but inseparable\\r\\nfrom its very nature. I would gladly tell all that I know about it, and never\\r\\npaint “No Admittance” on my gate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and am still on their\\r\\ntrail. Many are the travellers I have spoken concerning them, describing their\\r\\ntracks and what calls they answered to. I have met one or two who had heard the\\r\\nhound, and the tramp of the horse, and even seen the dove disappear behind a\\r\\ncloud, and they seemed as anxious to recover them as if they had lost them\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo anticipate, not the sunrise and the dawn merely, but, if possible, Nature\\r\\nherself! How many mornings, summer and winter, before yet any neighbor was\\r\\nstirring about his business, have I been about mine! No doubt, many of my\\r\\ntownsmen have met me returning from this enterprise, farmers starting for\\r\\nBoston in the twilight, or woodchoppers going to their work. It is true, I\\r\\nnever assisted the sun materially in his rising, but, doubt not, it was of the\\r\\nlast importance only to be present at it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo many autumn, ay, and winter days, spent outside the town, trying to hear\\r\\nwhat was in the wind, to hear and carry it express! I well-nigh sunk all my\\r\\ncapital in it, and lost my own breath into the bargain, running in the face of\\r\\nit. If it had concerned either of the political parties, depend upon it, it\\r\\nwould have appeared in the Gazette with the earliest intelligence. At other\\r\\ntimes watching from the observatory of some cliff or tree, to telegraph any new\\r\\narrival; or waiting at evening on the hill-tops for the sky to fall, that I\\r\\nmight catch something, though I never caught much, and that, manna-wise, would\\r\\ndissolve again in the sun.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor a long time I was reporter to a journal, of no very wide circulation, whose\\r\\neditor has never yet seen fit to print the bulk of my contributions, and, as is\\r\\ntoo common with writers, I got only my labor for my pains. However, in this\\r\\ncase my pains were their own reward.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor many years I was self-appointed inspector of snow storms and rain storms,\\r\\nand did my duty faithfully; surveyor, if not of highways, then of forest paths\\r\\nand all across-lot routes, keeping them open, and ravines bridged and passable\\r\\nat all seasons, where the public heel had testified to their utility.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have looked after the wild stock of the town, which give a faithful herdsman\\r\\na good deal of trouble by leaping fences; and I have had an eye to the\\r\\nunfrequented nooks and corners of the farm; though I did not always know\\r\\nwhether Jonas or Solomon worked in a particular field to-day; that was none of\\r\\nmy business. I have watered the red huckleberry, the sand cherry and the\\r\\nnettle tree, the red pine and the black ash, the white grape and the yellow\\r\\nviolet, which might have withered else in dry seasons.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn short, I went on thus for a long time, I may say it without boasting,\\r\\nfaithfully minding my business, till it became more and more evident that my\\r\\ntownsmen would not after all admit me into the list of town officers, nor make\\r\\nmy place a sinecure with a moderate allowance. My accounts, which I can swear\\r\\nto have kept faithfully, I have, indeed, never got audited, still less\\r\\naccepted, still less paid and settled. However, I have not set my heart on\\r\\nthat.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNot long since, a strolling Indian went to sell baskets at the house of a\\r\\nwell-known lawyer in my neighborhood. “Do you wish to buy any\\r\\nbaskets?” he asked. “No, we do not want any,” was the reply.\\r\\n“What!” exclaimed the Indian as he went out the gate, “do you\\r\\nmean to starve us?” Having seen his industrious white neighbors so well\\r\\noff,—that the lawyer had only to weave arguments, and by some magic,\\r\\nwealth and standing followed, he had said to himself; I will go into\\r\\nbusiness; I will weave baskets; it is a thing which I can do. Thinking that\\r\\nwhen he had made the baskets he would have done his part, and then it would be\\r\\nthe white man’s to buy them. He had not discovered that it was necessary\\r\\nfor him to make it worth the other’s while to buy them, or at least make\\r\\nhim think that it was so, or to make something else which it would be worth his\\r\\nwhile to buy. I too had woven a kind of basket of a delicate texture, but I had\\r\\nnot made it worth any one’s while to buy them. Yet not the less, in my\\r\\ncase, did I think it worth my while to weave them, and instead of studying how\\r\\nto make it worth men’s while to buy my baskets, I studied rather how to\\r\\navoid the necessity of selling them. The life which men praise and regard as\\r\\nsuccessful is but one kind. Why should we exaggerate any one kind at the\\r\\nexpense of the others?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFinding that my fellow-citizens were not likely to offer me any room in the\\r\\ncourt house, or any curacy or living any where else, but I must shift for\\r\\nmyself, I turned my face more exclusively than ever to the woods, where I was\\r\\nbetter known. I determined to go into business at once, and not wait to acquire\\r\\nthe usual capital, using such slender means as I had already got. My purpose in\\r\\ngoing to Walden Pond was not to live cheaply nor to live dearly there, but to\\r\\ntransact some private business with the fewest obstacles; to be hindered from\\r\\naccomplishing which for want of a little common sense, a little enterprise and\\r\\nbusiness talent, appeared not so sad as foolish.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have always endeavored to acquire strict business habits; they are\\r\\nindispensable to every man. If your trade is with the Celestial Empire, then\\r\\nsome small counting house on the coast, in some Salem harbor, will be fixture\\r\\nenough. You will export such articles as the country affords, purely native\\r\\nproducts, much ice and pine timber and a little granite, always in native\\r\\nbottoms. These will be good ventures. To oversee all the details yourself in\\r\\nperson; to be at once pilot and captain, and owner and underwriter; to buy and\\r\\nsell and keep the accounts; to read every letter received, and write or read\\r\\nevery letter sent; to superintend the discharge of imports night and day; to be\\r\\nupon many parts of the coast almost at the same time;—often the richest\\r\\nfreight will be discharged upon a Jersey shore;—to be your own telegraph,\\r\\nunweariedly sweeping the horizon, speaking all passing vessels bound coastwise;\\r\\nto keep up a steady despatch of commodities, for the supply of such a distant\\r\\nand exorbitant market; to keep yourself informed of the state of the markets,\\r\\nprospects of war and peace every where, and anticipate the tendencies of trade\\r\\nand civilization,—taking advantage of the results of all exploring\\r\\nexpeditions, using new passages and all improvements in\\r\\nnavigation;—charts to be studied, the position of reefs and new lights\\r\\nand buoys to be ascertained, and ever, and ever, the logarithmic tables to be\\r\\ncorrected, for by the error of some calculator the vessel often splits upon a\\r\\nrock that should have reached a friendly pier,—there is the untold fate of\\r\\nLa Perouse;—universal science to be kept pace with, studying the lives of\\r\\nall great discoverers and navigators, great adventurers and merchants, from\\r\\nHanno and the PhÅ\\x93nicians down to our day; in fine, account of stock to be\\r\\ntaken from time to time, to know how you stand. It is a labor to task the\\r\\nfaculties of a man,—such problems of profit and loss, of interest, of tare\\r\\nand tret, and gauging of all kinds in it, as demand a universal knowledge.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have thought that Walden Pond would be a good place for business, not solely\\r\\non account of the railroad and the ice trade; it offers advantages which it may\\r\\nnot be good policy to divulge; it is a good port and a good foundation. No Neva\\r\\nmarshes to be filled; though you must every where build on piles of your own\\r\\ndriving. It is said that a flood-tide, with a westerly wind, and ice in the\\r\\nNeva, would sweep St. Petersburg from the face of the earth.\\n\\n\\r\\nAs this business was to be entered into without the usual capital, it may not\\r\\nbe easy to conjecture where those means, that will still be indispensable to\\r\\nevery such undertaking, were to be obtained. As for Clothing, to come at once\\r\\nto the practical part of the question, perhaps we are led oftener by the love\\r\\nof novelty, and a regard for the opinions of men, in procuring it, than by a\\r\\ntrue utility. Let him who has work to do recollect that the object of clothing\\r\\nis, first, to retain the vital heat, and secondly, in this state of society, to\\r\\ncover nakedness, and he may judge how much of any necessary or important work\\r\\nmay be accomplished without adding to his wardrobe. Kings and queens who wear a\\r\\nsuit but once, though made by some tailor or dressmaker to their majesties,\\r\\ncannot know the comfort of wearing a suit that fits. They are no better than\\r\\nwooden horses to hang the clean clothes on. Every day our garments become more\\r\\nassimilated to ourselves, receiving the impress of the wearer’s\\r\\ncharacter, until we hesitate to lay them aside, without such delay and medical\\r\\nappliances and some such solemnity even as our bodies. No man ever stood the\\r\\nlower in my estimation for having a patch in his clothes; yet I am sure that\\r\\nthere is greater anxiety, commonly, to have fashionable, or at least clean and\\r\\nunpatched clothes, than to have a sound conscience. But even if the rent is not\\r\\nmended, perhaps the worst vice betrayed is improvidence. I sometimes try my\\r\\nacquaintances by such tests as this;—who could wear a patch, or two extra\\r\\nseams only, over the knee? Most behave as if they believed that their prospects\\r\\nfor life would be ruined if they should do it. It would be easier for them to\\r\\nhobble to town with a broken leg than with a broken pantaloon. Often if an\\r\\naccident happens to a gentleman’s legs, they can be mended; but if a\\r\\nsimilar accident happens to the legs of his pantaloons, there is no help for\\r\\nit; for he considers, not what is truly respectable, but what is respected. We\\r\\nknow but few men, a great many coats and breeches. Dress a scarecrow in your\\r\\nlast shift, you standing shiftless by, who would not soonest salute the\\r\\nscarecrow? Passing a cornfield the other day, close by a hat and coat on a\\r\\nstake, I recognized the owner of the farm. He was only a little more\\r\\nweather-beaten than when I saw him last. I have heard of a dog that barked at\\r\\nevery stranger who approached his master’s premises with clothes on, but\\r\\nwas easily quieted by a naked thief. It is an interesting question how far men\\r\\nwould retain their relative rank if they were divested of their clothes. Could\\r\\nyou, in such a case, tell surely of any company of civilized men, which\\r\\nbelonged to the most respected class? When Madam Pfeiffer, in her adventurous\\r\\ntravels round the world, from east to west, had got so near home as Asiatic\\r\\nRussia, she says that she felt the necessity of wearing other than a travelling\\r\\ndress, when she went to meet the authorities, for she “was now in a\\r\\ncivilized country, where —— — people are judged of by their\\r\\nclothes.” Even in our democratic New England towns the accidental\\r\\npossession of wealth, and its manifestation in dress and equipage alone, obtain\\r\\nfor the possessor almost universal respect. But they yield such respect,\\r\\nnumerous as they are, are so far heathen, and need to have a missionary sent to\\r\\nthem. Beside, clothes introduced sewing, a kind of work which you may call\\r\\nendless; a woman’s dress, at least, is never done.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA man who has at length found something to do will not need to get a new suit\\r\\nto do it in; for him the old will do, that has lain dusty in the garret for an\\r\\nindeterminate period. Old shoes will serve a hero longer than they have served\\r\\nhis valet,—if a hero ever has a valet,—bare feet are older than\\r\\nshoes, and he can make them do. Only they who go to soirÃ©es and legislative\\r\\nhalls must have new coats, coats to change as often as the man changes in them.\\r\\nBut if my jacket and trousers, my hat and shoes, are fit to worship God in,\\r\\nthey will do; will they not? Who ever saw his old clothes,—his old coat,\\r\\nactually worn out, resolved into its primitive elements, so that it was not a\\r\\ndeed of charity to bestow it on some poor boy, by him perchance to be bestowed\\r\\non some poorer still, or shall we say richer, who could do with less? I say,\\r\\nbeware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer\\r\\nof clothes. If there is not a new man, how can the new clothes be made to fit?\\r\\nIf you have any enterprise before you, try it in your old clothes. All men\\r\\nwant, not something to do with, but something to do, or rather\\r\\nsomething to be. Perhaps we should never procure a new suit, however\\r\\nragged or dirty the old, until we have so conducted, so enterprised or sailed\\r\\nin some way, that we feel like new men in the old, and that to retain it would\\r\\nbe like keeping new wine in old bottles. Our moulting season, like that of the\\r\\nfowls, must be a crisis in our lives. The loon retires to solitary ponds to\\r\\nspend it. Thus also the snake casts its slough, and the caterpillar its wormy\\r\\ncoat, by an internal industry and expansion; for clothes are but our outmost\\r\\ncuticle and mortal coil. Otherwise we shall be found sailing under false\\r\\ncolors, and be inevitably cashiered at last by our own opinion, as well as that\\r\\nof mankind.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe don garment after garment, as if we grew like exogenous plants by addition\\r\\nwithout. Our outside and often thin and fanciful clothes are our epidermis, or\\r\\nfalse skin, which partakes not of our life, and may be stripped off here and\\r\\nthere without fatal injury; our thicker garments, constantly worn, are our\\r\\ncellular integument, or cortex; but our shirts are our liber or true bark,\\r\\nwhich cannot be removed without girdling and so destroying the man. I believe\\r\\nthat all races at some seasons wear something equivalent to the shirt. It is\\r\\ndesirable that a man be clad so simply that he can lay his hands on himself in\\r\\nthe dark, and that he live in all respects so compactly and preparedly, that, if\\r\\nan enemy take the town, he can, like the old philosopher, walk out the gate\\r\\nempty-handed without anxiety. While one thick garment is, for most purposes, as\\r\\ngood as three thin ones, and cheap clothing can be obtained at prices really to\\r\\nsuit customers; while a thick coat can be bought for five dollars, which will\\r\\nlast as many years, thick pantaloons for two dollars, cowhide boots for a\\r\\ndollar and a half a pair, a summer hat for a quarter of a dollar, and a winter\\r\\ncap for sixty-two and a half cents, or a better be made at home at a nominal\\r\\ncost, where is he so poor that, clad in such a suit, of his own earning,\\r\\nthere will not be found wise men to do him reverence?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I ask for a garment of a particular form, my tailoress tells me gravely,\\r\\n“They do not make them so now,” not emphasizing the\\r\\n“They” at all, as if she quoted an authority as impersonal as the\\r\\nFates, and I find it difficult to get made what I want, simply because she\\r\\ncannot believe that I mean what I say, that I am so rash. When I hear this\\r\\noracular sentence, I am for a moment absorbed in thought, emphasizing to myself\\r\\neach word separately that I may come at the meaning of it, that I may find out\\r\\nby what degree of consanguinity They are related to me, and what\\r\\nauthority they may have in an affair which affects me so nearly; and, finally,\\r\\nI am inclined to answer her with equal mystery, and without any more emphasis\\r\\nof the “they,”—“It is true, they did not make them so\\r\\nrecently, but they do now.” Of what use this measuring of me if she does\\r\\nnot measure my character, but only the breadth of my shoulders, as it were a\\r\\npeg to hang the coat on? We worship not the Graces, nor the ParcÃ¦, but\\r\\nFashion. She spins and weaves and cuts with full authority. The head monkey at\\r\\nParis puts on a traveller’s cap, and all the monkeys in America do the\\r\\nsame. I sometimes despair of getting anything quite simple and honest done in\\r\\nthis world by the help of men. They would have to be passed through a powerful\\r\\npress first, to squeeze their old notions out of them, so that they would not\\r\\nsoon get upon their legs again, and then there would be some one in the company\\r\\nwith a maggot in his head, hatched from an egg deposited there nobody knows\\r\\nwhen, for not even fire kills these things, and you would have lost your labor.\\r\\nNevertheless, we will not forget that some Egyptian wheat was handed down to us\\r\\nby a mummy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn the whole, I think that it cannot be maintained that dressing has in this or\\r\\nany country risen to the dignity of an art. At present men make shift to wear\\r\\nwhat they can get. Like shipwrecked sailors, they put on what they can find on\\r\\nthe beach, and at a little distance, whether of space or time, laugh at each\\r\\nother’s masquerade. Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but\\r\\nfollows religiously the new. We are amused at beholding the costume of Henry\\r\\nVIII., or Queen Elizabeth, as much as if it was that of the King and Queen of\\r\\nthe Cannibal Islands. All costume off a man is pitiful or grotesque. It is only\\r\\nthe serious eye peering from and the sincere life passed within it, which\\r\\nrestrain laughter and consecrate the costume of any people. Let Harlequin be\\r\\ntaken with a fit of the colic and his trappings will have to serve that mood\\r\\ntoo. When the soldier is hit by a cannon ball rags are as becoming as purple.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe childish and savage taste of men and women for new patterns keeps how many\\r\\nshaking and squinting through kaleidoscopes that they may discover the\\r\\nparticular figure which this generation requires today. The manufacturers have\\r\\nlearned that this taste is merely whimsical. Of two patterns which differ only\\r\\nby a few threads more or less of a particular color, the one will be sold\\r\\nreadily, the other lie on the shelf, though it frequently happens that after\\r\\nthe lapse of a season the latter becomes the most fashionable. Comparatively,\\r\\ntattooing is not the hideous custom which it is called. It is not barbarous\\r\\nmerely because the printing is skin-deep and unalterable.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get\\r\\nclothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that\\r\\nof the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or\\r\\nobserved, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly\\r\\nclad, but, unquestionably, that corporations may be enriched. In the long run\\r\\nmen hit only what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately,\\r\\nthey had better aim at something high.\\n\\n\\r\\nAs for a Shelter, I will not deny that this is now a necessary of life, though\\r\\nthere are instances of men having done without it for long periods in colder\\r\\ncountries than this. Samuel Laing says that “the Laplander in his skin\\r\\ndress, and in a skin bag which he puts over his head and shoulders, will sleep\\r\\nnight after night on the snow—in a degree of cold which would extinguish\\r\\nthe life of one exposed to it in any woollen clothing.” He had seen them\\r\\nasleep thus. Yet he adds, “They are not hardier than other people.”\\r\\nBut, probably, man did not live long on the earth without discovering the\\r\\nconvenience which there is in a house, the domestic comforts, which phrase may\\r\\nhave originally signified the satisfactions of the house more than of the\\r\\nfamily; though these must be extremely partial and occasional in those climates\\r\\nwhere the house is associated in our thoughts with winter or the rainy season\\r\\nchiefly, and two thirds of the year, except for a parasol, is unnecessary. In\\r\\nour climate, in the summer, it was formerly almost solely a covering at night.\\r\\nIn the Indian gazettes a wigwam was the symbol of a day’s march, and a\\r\\nrow of them cut or painted on the bark of a tree signified that so many times\\r\\nthey had camped. Man was not made so large limbed and robust but that he must\\r\\nseek to narrow his world, and wall in a space such as fitted him. He was at\\r\\nfirst bare and out of doors; but though this was pleasant enough in serene and\\r\\nwarm weather, by daylight, the rainy season and the winter, to say nothing of\\r\\nthe torrid sun, would perhaps have nipped his race in the bud if he had not\\r\\nmade haste to clothe himself with the shelter of a house. Adam and Eve,\\r\\naccording to the fable, wore the bower before other clothes. Man wanted a home,\\r\\na place of warmth, or comfort, first of physical warmth, then the warmth of the\\r\\naffections.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe may imagine a time when, in the infancy of the human race, some enterprising\\r\\nmortal crept into a hollow in a rock for shelter. Every child begins the world\\r\\nagain, to some extent, and loves to stay out doors, even in wet and cold. It\\r\\nplays house, as well as horse, having an instinct for it. Who does not remember\\r\\nthe interest with which when young he looked at shelving rocks, or any approach\\r\\nto a cave? It was the natural yearning of that portion of our most primitive\\r\\nancestor which still survived in us. From the cave we have advanced to roofs of\\r\\npalm leaves, of bark and boughs, of linen woven and stretched, of grass and\\r\\nstraw, of boards and shingles, of stones and tiles. At last, we know not what\\r\\nit is to live in the open air, and our lives are domestic in more senses than\\r\\nwe think. From the hearth to the field is a great distance. It would be well\\r\\nperhaps if we were to spend more of our days and nights without any\\r\\nobstruction between us and the celestial bodies, if the poet did not speak so\\r\\nmuch from under a roof, or the saint dwell there so long. Birds do not sing in\\r\\ncaves, nor do doves cherish their innocence in dovecots.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHowever, if one designs to construct a dwelling house, it behooves him to\\r\\nexercise a little Yankee shrewdness, lest after all he find himself in a\\r\\nworkhouse, a labyrinth without a clue, a museum, an almshouse, a prison, or a\\r\\nsplendid mausoleum instead. Consider first how slight a shelter is absolutely\\r\\nnecessary. I have seen Penobscot Indians, in this town, living in tents of thin\\r\\ncotton cloth, while the snow was nearly a foot deep around them, and I thought\\r\\nthat they would be glad to have it deeper to keep out the wind. Formerly, when\\r\\nhow to get my living honestly, with freedom left for my proper pursuits, was a\\r\\nquestion which vexed me even more than it does now, for unfortunately I am\\r\\nbecome somewhat callous, I used to see a large box by the railroad, six feet\\r\\nlong by three wide, in which the laborers locked up their tools at night, and\\r\\nit suggested to me that every man who was hard pushed might get such a one for\\r\\na dollar, and, having bored a few auger holes in it, to admit the air at least,\\r\\nget into it when it rained and at night, and hook down the lid, and so have\\r\\nfreedom in his love, and in his soul be free. This did not appear the worst,\\r\\nnor by any means a despicable alternative. You could sit up as late as you\\r\\npleased, and, whenever you got up, go abroad without any landlord or house-lord\\r\\ndogging you for rent. Many a man is harassed to death to pay the rent of a\\r\\nlarger and more luxurious box who would not have frozen to death in such a box\\r\\nas this. I am far from jesting. Economy is a subject which admits of being\\r\\ntreated with levity, but it cannot so be disposed of. A comfortable house for a\\r\\nrude and hardy race, that lived mostly out of doors, was once made here almost\\r\\nentirely of such materials as Nature furnished ready to their hands. Gookin,\\r\\nwho was superintendent of the Indians subject to the Massachusetts Colony,\\r\\nwriting in 1674, says, “The best of their houses are covered very neatly,\\r\\ntight and warm, with barks of trees, slipped from their bodies at those seasons\\r\\nwhen the sap is up, and made into great flakes, with pressure of weighty\\r\\ntimber, when they are green.... The meaner sort are covered with mats which\\r\\nthey make of a kind of bulrush, and are also indifferently tight and warm, but\\r\\nnot so good as the former.... Some I have seen, sixty or a hundred feet long\\r\\nand thirty feet broad.... I have often lodged in their wigwams, and found them\\r\\nas warm as the best English houses.” He adds, that they were commonly\\r\\ncarpeted and lined within with well-wrought embroidered mats, and were\\r\\nfurnished with various utensils. The Indians had advanced so far as to regulate\\r\\nthe effect of the wind by a mat suspended over the hole in the roof and moved\\r\\nby a string. Such a lodge was in the first instance constructed in a day or two\\r\\nat most, and taken down and put up in a few hours; and every family owned one,\\r\\nor its apartment in one.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the savage state every family owns a shelter as good as the best, and\\r\\nsufficient for its coarser and simpler wants; but I think that I speak within\\r\\nbounds when I say that, though the birds of the air have their nests, and the\\r\\nfoxes their holes, and the savages their wigwams, in modern civilized society\\r\\nnot more than one half the families own a shelter. In the large towns and\\r\\ncities, where civilization especially prevails, the number of those who own a\\r\\nshelter is a very small fraction of the whole. The rest pay an annual tax for\\r\\nthis outside garment of all, become indispensable summer and winter, which\\r\\nwould buy a village of Indian wigwams, but now helps to keep them poor as long\\r\\nas they live. I do not mean to insist here on the disadvantage of hiring\\r\\ncompared with owning, but it is evident that the savage owns his shelter\\r\\nbecause it costs so little, while the civilized man hires his commonly because\\r\\nhe cannot afford to own it; nor can he, in the long run, any better afford to\\r\\nhire. But, answers one, by merely paying this tax the poor civilized man\\r\\nsecures an abode which is a palace compared with the savage’s. An annual\\r\\nrent of from twenty-five to a hundred dollars, these are the country rates,\\r\\nentitles him to the benefit of the improvements of centuries, spacious\\r\\napartments, clean paint and paper, Rumford fireplace, back plastering, Venetian\\r\\nblinds, copper pump, spring lock, a commodious cellar, and many other things.\\r\\nBut how happens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly a\\r\\npoor civilized man, while the savage, who has them not, is rich as a\\r\\nsavage? If it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in the condition\\r\\nof man,—and I think that it is, though only the wise improve their\\r\\nadvantages,—it must be shown that it has produced better dwellings\\r\\nwithout making them more costly; and the cost of a thing is the amount of what\\r\\nI will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in\\r\\nthe long run. An average house in this neighborhood costs perhaps eight hundred\\r\\ndollars, and to lay up this sum will take from ten to fifteen years of the\\r\\nlaborer’s life, even if he is not encumbered with a\\r\\nfamily;—estimating the pecuniary value of every man’s labor at one\\r\\ndollar a day, for if some receive more, others receive less;—so that he\\r\\nmust have spent more than half his life commonly before his wigwam will\\r\\nbe earned. If we suppose him to pay a rent instead, this is but a doubtful\\r\\nchoice of evils. Would the savage have been wise to exchange his wigwam for a\\r\\npalace on these terms?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt may be guessed that I reduce almost the whole advantage of holding this\\r\\nsuperfluous property as a fund in store against the future, so far as the\\r\\nindividual is concerned, mainly to the defraying of funeral expenses. But\\r\\nperhaps a man is not required to bury himself. Nevertheless this points to an\\r\\nimportant distinction between the civilized man and the savage; and, no doubt,\\r\\nthey have designs on us for our benefit, in making the life of a civilized\\r\\npeople an institution, in which the life of the individual is to a great\\r\\nextent absorbed, in order to preserve and perfect that of the race. But I wish\\r\\nto show at what a sacrifice this advantage is at present obtained, and to\\r\\nsuggest that we may possibly so live as to secure all the advantage without\\r\\nsuffering any of the disadvantage. What mean ye by saying that the poor ye have\\r\\nalways with you, or that the fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the\\r\\nchildren’s teeth are set on edge?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to\\r\\nuse this proverb in Israel.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Behold all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul\\r\\nof the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I consider my neighbors, the farmers of Concord, who are at least as well\\r\\noff as the other classes, I find that for the most part they have been toiling\\r\\ntwenty, thirty, or forty years, that they may become the real owners of their\\r\\nfarms, which commonly they have inherited with encumbrances, or else bought\\r\\nwith hired money,—and we may regard one third of that toil as the cost of\\r\\ntheir houses,—but commonly they have not paid for them yet. It is true,\\r\\nthe encumbrances sometimes outweigh the value of the farm, so that the farm\\r\\nitself becomes one great encumbrance, and still a man is found to inherit it,\\r\\nbeing well acquainted with it, as he says. On applying to the assessors, I am\\r\\nsurprised to learn that they cannot at once name a dozen in the town who own\\r\\ntheir farms free and clear. If you would know the history of these homesteads,\\r\\ninquire at the bank where they are mortgaged. The man who has actually paid for\\r\\nhis farm with labor on it is so rare that every neighbor can point to him. I\\r\\ndoubt if there are three such men in Concord. What has been said of the\\r\\nmerchants, that a very large majority, even ninety-seven in a hundred, are sure\\r\\nto fail, is equally true of the farmers. With regard to the merchants, however,\\r\\none of them says pertinently that a great part of their failures are not\\r\\ngenuine pecuniary failures, but merely failures to fulfil their engagements,\\r\\nbecause it is inconvenient; that is, it is the moral character that breaks\\r\\ndown. But this puts an infinitely worse face on the matter, and suggests,\\r\\nbeside, that probably not even the other three succeed in saving their souls,\\r\\nbut are perchance bankrupt in a worse sense than they who fail honestly.\\r\\nBankruptcy and repudiation are the springboards from which much of our\\r\\ncivilization vaults and turns its somersets, but the savage stands on the\\r\\nunelastic plank of famine. Yet the Middlesex Cattle Show goes off here with\\r\\nÃ©clat annually, as if all the joints of the agricultural machine were\\r\\nsuent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe farmer is endeavoring to solve the problem of a livelihood by a formula\\r\\nmore complicated than the problem itself. To get his shoestrings he speculates\\r\\nin herds of cattle. With consummate skill he has set his trap with a hair\\r\\nspring to catch comfort and independence, and then, as he turned away, got his\\r\\nown leg into it. This is the reason he is poor; and for a similar reason we are\\r\\nall poor in respect to a thousand savage comforts, though surrounded by\\r\\nluxuries. As Chapman sings,—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The false society of men—\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0—for earthly greatness\\r\\nAll heavenly comforts rarefies to air.”\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd when the farmer has got his house, he may not be the richer but the poorer\\r\\nfor it, and it be the house that has got him. As I understand it, that was a\\r\\nvalid objection urged by Momus against the house which Minerva made, that she\\r\\n“had not made it movable, by which means a bad neighborhood might be\\r\\navoided;” and it may still be urged, for our houses are such unwieldy\\r\\nproperty that we are often imprisoned rather than housed in them; and the bad\\r\\nneighborhood to be avoided is our own scurvy selves. I know one or two\\r\\nfamilies, at least, in this town, who, for nearly a generation, have been\\r\\nwishing to sell their houses in the outskirts and move into the village, but\\r\\nhave not been able to accomplish it, and only death will set them free.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGranted that the majority are able at last either to own or hire the\\r\\nmodern house with all its improvements. While civilization has been improving\\r\\nour houses, it has not equally improved the men who are to inhabit them. It has\\r\\ncreated palaces, but it was not so easy to create noblemen and kings. And if\\r\\nthe civilized man’s pursuits are no worthier than the savage’s, if\\r\\nhe is employed the greater part of his life in obtaining gross necessaries and\\r\\ncomforts merely, why should he have a better dwelling than the former?\\n\\n\\r\\nBut how do the poor minority fare? Perhaps it will be found, that just in\\r\\nproportion as some have been placed in outward circumstances above the savage,\\r\\nothers have been degraded below him. The luxury of one class is counterbalanced\\r\\nby the indigence of another. On the one side is the palace, on the other are\\r\\nthe almshouse and “silent poor.” The myriads who built the pyramids\\r\\nto be the tombs of the Pharaohs were fed on garlic, and it may be were not\\r\\ndecently buried themselves. The mason who finishes the cornice of the palace\\r\\nreturns at night perchance to a hut not so good as a wigwam. It is a mistake to\\r\\nsuppose that, in a country where the usual evidences of civilization exist, the\\r\\ncondition of a very large body of the inhabitants may not be as degraded as\\r\\nthat of savages. I refer to the degraded poor, not now to the degraded rich. To\\r\\nknow this I should not need to look farther than to the shanties which\\r\\nevery where border our railroads, that last improvement in civilization; where I\\r\\nsee in my daily walks human beings living in sties, and all winter with an open\\r\\ndoor, for the sake of light, without any visible, often imaginable, wood pile,\\r\\nand the forms of both old and young are permanently contracted by the long\\r\\nhabit of shrinking from cold and misery, and the development of all their limbs\\r\\nand faculties is checked. It certainly is fair to look at that class by whose\\r\\nlabor the works which distinguish this generation are accomplished. Such too,\\r\\nto a greater or less extent, is the condition of the operatives of every\\r\\ndenomination in England, which is the great workhouse of the world. Or I could\\r\\nrefer you to Ireland, which is marked as one of the white or enlightened spots\\r\\non the map. Contrast the physical condition of the Irish with that of the North\\r\\nAmerican Indian, or the South Sea Islander, or any other savage race before it\\r\\nwas degraded by contact with the civilized man. Yet I have no doubt that that\\r\\npeople’s rulers are as wise as the average of civilized rulers. Their\\r\\ncondition only proves what squalidness may consist with civilization. I hardly\\r\\nneed refer now to the laborers in our Southern States who produce the staple\\r\\nexports of this country, and are themselves a staple production of the South.\\r\\nBut to confine myself to those who are said to be in moderate\\r\\ncircumstances.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMost men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are actually\\r\\nthough needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have\\r\\nsuch a one as their neighbors have. As if one were to wear any sort of coat\\r\\nwhich the tailor might cut out for him, or, gradually leaving off palmleaf hat\\r\\nor cap of woodchuck skin, complain of hard times because he could not afford to\\r\\nbuy him a crown! It is possible to invent a house still more convenient and\\r\\nluxurious than we have, which yet all would admit that man could not afford to\\r\\npay for. Shall we always study to obtain more of these things, and not\\r\\nsometimes to be content with less? Shall the respectable citizen thus gravely\\r\\nteach, by precept and example, the necessity of the young man’s providing\\r\\na certain number of superfluous glow-shoes, and umbrellas, and empty guest\\r\\nchambers for empty guests, before he dies? Why should not our furniture be as\\r\\nsimple as the Arab’s or the Indian’s? When I think of the\\r\\nbenefactors of the race, whom we have apotheosized as messengers from heaven,\\r\\nbearers of divine gifts to man, I do not see in my mind any retinue at their\\r\\nheels, any car-load of fashionable furniture. Or what if I were to\\r\\nallow—would it not be a singular allowance?—that our furniture\\r\\nshould be more complex than the Arab’s, in proportion as we are morally\\r\\nand intellectually his superiors! At present our houses are cluttered and\\r\\ndefiled with it, and a good housewife would sweep out the greater part into the\\r\\ndust hole, and not leave her morning’s work undone. Morning work! By the\\r\\nblushes of Aurora and the music of Memnon, what should be man’s\\r\\nmorning work in this world? I had three pieces of limestone on my desk,\\r\\nbut I was terrified to find that they required to be dusted daily, when the\\r\\nfurniture of my mind was all undusted still, and I threw them out the window in\\r\\ndisgust. How, then, could I have a furnished house? I would rather sit in the\\r\\nopen air, for no dust gathers on the grass, unless where man has broken ground.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is the luxurious and dissipated who set the fashions which the herd so\\r\\ndiligently follow. The traveller who stops at the best houses, so called, soon\\r\\ndiscovers this, for the publicans presume him to be a Sardanapalus, and if he\\r\\nresigned himself to their tender mercies he would soon be completely\\r\\nemasculated. I think that in the railroad car we are inclined to spend more on\\r\\nluxury than on safety and convenience, and it threatens without attaining these\\r\\nto become no better than a modern drawing room, with its divans, and ottomans,\\r\\nand sun-shades, and a hundred other oriental things, which we are taking west\\r\\nwith us, invented for the ladies of the harem and the effeminate natives of the\\r\\nCelestial Empire, which Jonathan should be ashamed to know the names of. I\\r\\nwould rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be crowded on a\\r\\nvelvet cushion. I would rather ride on earth in an ox cart with a free\\r\\ncirculation, than go to heaven in the fancy car of an excursion train and\\r\\nbreathe a malaria all the way.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe very simplicity and nakedness of man’s life in the primitive ages\\r\\nimply this advantage at least, that they left him still but a sojourner in\\r\\nnature. When he was refreshed with food and sleep he contemplated his journey\\r\\nagain. He dwelt, as it were, in a tent in this world, and was either threading\\r\\nthe valleys, or crossing the plains, or climbing the mountain tops. But lo! men\\r\\nhave become the tools of their tools. The man who independently plucked the\\r\\nfruits when he was hungry is become a farmer; and he who stood under a tree for\\r\\nshelter, a housekeeper. We now no longer camp as for a night, but have settled\\r\\ndown on earth and forgotten heaven. We have adopted Christianity merely as an\\r\\nimproved method of agri-culture. We have built for this world a family\\r\\nmansion, and for the next a family tomb. The best works of art are the\\r\\nexpression of man’s struggle to free himself from this condition, but the\\r\\neffect of our art is merely to make this low state comfortable and that higher\\r\\nstate to be forgotten. There is actually no place in this village for a work of\\r\\nfine art, if any had come down to us, to stand, for our lives, our\\r\\nhouses and streets, furnish no proper pedestal for it. There is not a nail to\\r\\nhang a picture on, nor a shelf to receive the bust of a hero or a saint. When I\\r\\nconsider how our houses are built and paid for, or not paid for, and their\\r\\ninternal economy managed and sustained, I wonder that the floor does not give\\r\\nway under the visitor while he is admiring the gewgaws upon the mantel-piece,\\r\\nand let him through into the cellar, to some solid and honest though earthy\\r\\nfoundation. I cannot but perceive that this so called rich and refined life is\\r\\na thing jumped at, and I do not get on in the enjoyment of the fine arts\\r\\nwhich adorn it, my attention being wholly occupied with the jump; for I\\r\\nremember that the greatest genuine leap, due to human muscles alone, on record,\\r\\nis that of certain wandering Arabs, who are said to have cleared twenty-five\\r\\nfeet on level ground. Without factitious support, man is sure to come to earth\\r\\nagain beyond that distance. The first question which I am tempted to put to the\\r\\nproprietor of such great impropriety is, Who bolsters you? Are you one of the\\r\\nninety-seven who fail, or of the three who succeed? Answer me these questions,\\r\\nand then perhaps I may look at your bawbles and find them ornamental. The cart\\r\\nbefore the horse is neither beautiful nor useful. Before we can adorn our\\r\\nhouses with beautiful objects the walls must be stripped, and our lives must be\\r\\nstripped, and beautiful housekeeping and beautiful living be laid for a\\r\\nfoundation: now, a taste for the beautiful is most cultivated out of doors,\\r\\nwhere there is no house and no housekeeper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOld Johnson, in his “Wonder-Working Providence,” speaking of the\\r\\nfirst settlers of this town, with whom he was contemporary, tells us that\\r\\n“they burrow themselves in the earth for their first shelter under some\\r\\nhillside, and, casting the soil aloft upon timber, they make a smoky fire\\r\\nagainst the earth, at the highest side.” They did not “provide them\\r\\nhouses,” says he, “till the earth, by the Lord’s blessing,\\r\\nbrought forth bread to feed them,” and the first year’s crop was so\\r\\nlight that “they were forced to cut their bread very thin for a long\\r\\nseason.” The secretary of the Province of New Netherland, writing in\\r\\nDutch, in 1650, for the information of those who wished to take up land there,\\r\\nstates more particularly that “those in New Netherland, and especially in\\r\\nNew England, who have no means to build farmhouses at first according to their\\r\\nwishes, dig a square pit in the ground, cellar fashion, six or seven feet deep,\\r\\nas long and as broad as they think proper, case the earth inside with wood all\\r\\nround the wall, and line the wood with the bark of trees or something else to\\r\\nprevent the caving in of the earth; floor this cellar with plank, and wainscot\\r\\nit overhead for a ceiling, raise a roof of spars clear up, and cover the spars\\r\\nwith bark or green sods, so that they can live dry and warm in these houses\\r\\nwith their entire families for two, three, and four years, it being understood\\r\\nthat partitions are run through those cellars which are adapted to the size of\\r\\nthe family. The wealthy and principal men in New England, in the beginning of\\r\\nthe colonies, commenced their first dwelling houses in this fashion for two\\r\\nreasons; firstly, in order not to waste time in building, and not to want food\\r\\nthe next season; secondly, in order not to discourage poor laboring people whom\\r\\nthey brought over in numbers from Fatherland. In the course of three or four\\r\\nyears, when the country became adapted to agriculture, they built themselves\\r\\nhandsome houses, spending on them several thousands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn this course which our ancestors took there was a show of prudence at least,\\r\\nas if their principle were to satisfy the more pressing wants first. But are\\r\\nthe more pressing wants satisfied now? When I think of acquiring for myself one\\r\\nof our luxurious dwellings, I am deterred, for, so to speak, the country is not\\r\\nyet adapted to human culture, and we are still forced to cut our\\r\\nspiritual bread far thinner than our forefathers did their wheaten. Not\\r\\nthat all architectural ornament is to be neglected even in the rudest periods;\\r\\nbut let our houses first be lined with beauty, where they come in contact with\\r\\nour lives, like the tenement of the shellfish, and not overlaid with it. But,\\r\\nalas! I have been inside one or two of them, and know what they are lined with.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThough we are not so degenerate but that we might possibly live in a cave or a\\r\\nwigwam or wear skins today, it certainly is better to accept the advantages,\\r\\nthough so dearly bought, which the invention and industry of mankind offer. In\\r\\nsuch a neighborhood as this, boards and shingles, lime and bricks, are cheaper\\r\\nand more easily obtained than suitable caves, or whole logs, or bark in\\r\\nsufficient quantities, or even well-tempered clay or flat stones. I speak\\r\\nunderstandingly on this subject, for I have made myself acquainted with it both\\r\\ntheoretically and practically. With a little more wit we might use these\\r\\nmaterials so as to become richer than the richest now are, and make our\\r\\ncivilization a blessing. The civilized man is a more experienced and wiser\\r\\nsavage. But to make haste to my own experiment.\\n\\n\\r\\nNear the end of March, 1845, I borrowed an axe and went down to the woods by\\r\\nWalden Pond, nearest to where I intended to build my house, and began to cut\\r\\ndown some tall, arrowy white pines, still in their youth, for timber. It is\\r\\ndifficult to begin without borrowing, but perhaps it is the most generous\\r\\ncourse thus to permit your fellow-men to have an interest in your enterprise.\\r\\nThe owner of the axe, as he released his hold on it, said that it was the apple\\r\\nof his eye; but I returned it sharper than I received it. It was a pleasant\\r\\nhillside where I worked, covered with pine woods, through which I looked out on\\r\\nthe pond, and a small open field in the woods where pines and hickories were\\r\\nspringing up. The ice in the pond was not yet dissolved, though there were some\\r\\nopen spaces, and it was all dark colored and saturated with water. There were\\r\\nsome slight flurries of snow during the days that I worked there; but for the\\r\\nmost part when I came out on to the railroad, on my way home, its yellow sand\\r\\nheap stretched away gleaming in the hazy atmosphere, and the rails shone in the\\r\\nspring sun, and I heard the lark and pewee and other birds already come to\\r\\ncommence another year with us. They were pleasant spring days, in which the\\r\\nwinter of man’s discontent was thawing as well as the earth, and the life\\r\\nthat had lain torpid began to stretch itself. One day, when my axe had come off\\r\\nand I had cut a green hickory for a wedge, driving it with a stone, and had\\r\\nplaced the whole to soak in a pond hole in order to swell the wood, I saw a\\r\\nstriped snake run into the water, and he lay on the bottom, apparently without\\r\\ninconvenience, as long as I stayed there, or more than a quarter of an hour;\\r\\nperhaps because he had not yet fairly come out of the torpid state. It appeared\\r\\nto me that for a like reason men remain in their present low and primitive\\r\\ncondition; but if they should feel the influence of the spring of springs\\r\\narousing them, they would of necessity rise to a higher and more ethereal life.\\r\\nI had previously seen the snakes in frosty mornings in my path with portions of\\r\\ntheir bodies still numb and inflexible, waiting for the sun to thaw them. On\\r\\nthe 1st of April it rained and melted the ice, and in the early part of the\\r\\nday, which was very foggy, I heard a stray goose groping about over the pond\\r\\nand cackling as if lost, or like the spirit of the fog.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo I went on for some days cutting and hewing timber, and also studs and\\r\\nrafters, all with my narrow axe, not having many communicable or scholar-like\\r\\nthoughts, singing to myself,—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMen say they know many things;\\r\\nBut lo! they have taken wings,—\\r\\nThe arts and sciences,\\r\\nAnd a thousand appliances;\\r\\nThe wind that blows\\r\\nIs all that any body knows.\\n\\n\\r\\nI hewed the main timbers six inches square, most of the studs on two sides\\r\\nonly, and the rafters and floor timbers on one side, leaving the rest of the\\r\\nbark on, so that they were just as straight and much stronger than sawed ones.\\r\\nEach stick was carefully mortised or tenoned by its stump, for I had borrowed\\r\\nother tools by this time. My days in the woods were not very long ones; yet I\\r\\nusually carried my dinner of bread and butter, and read the newspaper in which\\r\\nit was wrapped, at noon, sitting amid the green pine boughs which I had cut\\r\\noff, and to my bread was imparted some of their fragrance, for my hands were\\r\\ncovered with a thick coat of pitch. Before I had done I was more the friend\\r\\nthan the foe of the pine tree, though I had cut down some of them, having\\r\\nbecome better acquainted with it. Sometimes a rambler in the wood was attracted\\r\\nby the sound of my axe, and we chatted pleasantly over the chips which I had\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy the middle of April, for I made no haste in my work, but rather made the\\r\\nmost of it, my house was framed and ready for the raising. I had already bought\\r\\nthe shanty of James Collins, an Irishman who worked on the Fitchburg Railroad,\\r\\nfor boards. James Collins’ shanty was considered an uncommonly fine one.\\r\\nWhen I called to see it he was not at home. I walked about the outside, at\\r\\nfirst unobserved from within, the window was so deep and high. It was of small\\r\\ndimensions, with a peaked cottage roof, and not much else to be seen, the dirt\\r\\nbeing raised five feet all around as if it were a compost heap. The roof was\\r\\nthe soundest part, though a good deal warped and made brittle by the sun.\\r\\nDoor-sill there was none, but a perennial passage for the hens under the door\\r\\nboard. Mrs. C. came to the door and asked me to view it from the inside. The\\r\\nhens were driven in by my approach. It was dark, and had a dirt floor for the\\r\\nmost part, dank, clammy, and aguish, only here a board and there a board which\\r\\nwould not bear removal. She lighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof\\r\\nand the walls, and also that the board floor extended under the bed, warning me\\r\\nnot to step into the cellar, a sort of dust hole two feet deep. In her own\\r\\nwords, they were “good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a\\r\\ngood window,”—of two whole squares originally, only the cat had\\r\\npassed out that way lately. There was a stove, a bed, and a place to sit, an\\r\\ninfant in the house where it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed\\r\\nlooking-glass, and a patent new coffee mill nailed to an oak sapling, all told.\\r\\nThe bargain was soon concluded, for James had in the meanwhile returned. I to\\r\\npay four dollars and twenty-five cents to-night, he to vacate at five to-morrow\\r\\nmorning, selling to nobody else meanwhile: I to take possession at six. It were\\r\\nwell, he said, to be there early, and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly\\r\\nunjust claims on the score of ground rent and fuel. This he assured me was the\\r\\nonly encumbrance. At six I passed him and his family on the road. One large\\r\\nbundle held their all,—bed, coffee-mill, looking-glass, hens,—all but\\r\\nthe cat, she took to the woods and became a wild cat, and, as I learned\\r\\nafterward, trod in a trap set for woodchucks, and so became a dead cat at last.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI took down this dwelling the same morning, drawing the nails, and removed it\\r\\nto the pond side by small cartloads, spreading the boards on the grass there to\\r\\nbleach and warp back again in the sun. One early thrush gave me a note or two\\r\\nas I drove along the woodland path. I was informed treacherously by a young\\r\\nPatrick that neighbor Seeley, an Irishman, in the intervals of the carting,\\r\\ntransferred the still tolerable, straight, and drivable nails, staples, and\\r\\nspikes to his pocket, and then stood when I came back to pass the time of day,\\r\\nand look freshly up, unconcerned, with spring thoughts, at the devastation;\\r\\nthere being a dearth of work, as he said. He was there to represent\\r\\nspectatordom, and help make this seemingly insignificant event one with the\\r\\nremoval of the gods of Troy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI dug my cellar in the side of a hill sloping to the south, where a woodchuck\\r\\nhad formerly dug his burrow, down through sumach and blackberry roots, and the\\r\\nlowest stain of vegetation, six feet square by seven deep, to a fine sand where\\r\\npotatoes would not freeze in any winter. The sides were left shelving, and not\\r\\nstoned; but the sun having never shone on them, the sand still keeps its place.\\r\\nIt was but two hours’ work. I took particular pleasure in this breaking\\r\\nof ground, for in almost all latitudes men dig into the earth for an equable\\r\\ntemperature. Under the most splendid house in the city is still to be found the\\r\\ncellar where they store their roots as of old, and long after the\\r\\nsuperstructure has disappeared posterity remark its dent in the earth. The\\r\\nhouse is still but a sort of porch at the entrance of a burrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt length, in the beginning of May, with the help of some of my acquaintances,\\r\\nrather to improve so good an occasion for neighborliness than from any\\r\\nnecessity, I set up the frame of my house. No man was ever more honored in the\\r\\ncharacter of his raisers than I. They are destined, I trust, to assist at the\\r\\nraising of loftier structures one day. I began to occupy my house on the 4th of\\r\\nJuly, as soon as it was boarded and roofed, for the boards were carefully\\r\\nfeather-edged and lapped, so that it was perfectly impervious to rain; but\\r\\nbefore boarding I laid the foundation of a chimney at one end, bringing two\\r\\ncartloads of stones up the hill from the pond in my arms. I built the chimney\\r\\nafter my hoeing in the fall, before a fire became necessary for warmth, doing\\r\\nmy cooking in the mean while out of doors on the ground, early in the morning:\\r\\nwhich mode I still think is in some respects more convenient and agreeable than\\r\\nthe usual one. When it stormed before my bread was baked, I fixed a few boards\\r\\nover the fire, and sat under them to watch my loaf, and passed some pleasant\\r\\nhours in that way. In those days, when my hands were much employed, I read but\\r\\nlittle, but the least scraps of paper which lay on the ground, my holder, or\\r\\ntablecloth, afforded me as much entertainment, in fact answered the same\\r\\npurpose as the Iliad.\\n\\n\\r\\nIt would be worth the while to build still more deliberately than I did,\\r\\nconsidering, for instance, what foundation a door, a window, a cellar, a\\r\\ngarret, have in the nature of man, and perchance never raising any\\r\\nsuperstructure until we found a better reason for it than our temporal\\r\\nnecessities even. There is some of the same fitness in a man’s building\\r\\nhis own house that there is in a bird’s building its own nest. Who knows\\r\\nbut if men constructed their dwellings with their own hands, and provided food\\r\\nfor themselves and families simply and honestly enough, the poetic faculty\\r\\nwould be universally developed, as birds universally sing when they are so\\r\\nengaged? But alas! we do like cowbirds and cuckoos, which lay their eggs in\\r\\nnests which other birds have built, and cheer no traveller with their\\r\\nchattering and unmusical notes. Shall we forever resign the pleasure of\\r\\nconstruction to the carpenter? What does architecture amount to in the\\r\\nexperience of the mass of men? I never in all my walks came across a man\\r\\nengaged in so simple and natural an occupation as building his house. We belong\\r\\nto the community. It is not the tailor alone who is the ninth part of a man; it\\r\\nis as much the preacher, and the merchant, and the farmer. Where is this\\r\\ndivision of labor to end? and what object does it finally serve? No doubt\\r\\nanother may also think for me; but it is not therefore desirable that he\\r\\nshould do so to the exclusion of my thinking for myself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTrue, there are architects so called in this country, and I have heard of one\\r\\nat least possessed with the idea of making architectural ornaments have a core\\r\\nof truth, a necessity, and hence a beauty, as if it were a revelation to him.\\r\\nAll very well perhaps from his point of view, but only a little better than the\\r\\ncommon dilettantism. A sentimental reformer in architecture, he began at the\\r\\ncornice, not at the foundation. It was only how to put a core of truth within\\r\\nthe ornaments, that every sugar plum in fact might have an almond or caraway\\r\\nseed in it,—though I hold that almonds are most wholesome without the\\r\\nsugar,—and not how the inhabitant, the indweller, might build truly\\r\\nwithin and without, and let the ornaments take care of themselves. What\\r\\nreasonable man ever supposed that ornaments were something outward and in the\\r\\nskin merely,—that the tortoise got his spotted shell, or the shellfish\\r\\nits mother-o’-pearl tints, by such a contract as the inhabitants of\\r\\nBroadway their Trinity Church? But a man has no more to do with the style of\\r\\narchitecture of his house than a tortoise with that of its shell: nor need the\\r\\nsoldier be so idle as to try to paint the precise color of his virtue on his\\r\\nstandard. The enemy will find it out. He may turn pale when the trial comes.\\r\\nThis man seemed to me to lean over the cornice, and timidly whisper his half\\r\\ntruth to the rude occupants who really knew it better than he. What of\\r\\narchitectural beauty I now see, I know has gradually grown from within outward,\\r\\nout of the necessities and character of the indweller, who is the only\\r\\nbuilder,—out of some unconscious truthfulness, and nobleness, without\\r\\never a thought for the appearance and whatever additional beauty of this kind\\r\\nis destined to be produced will be preceded by a like unconscious beauty of\\r\\nlife. The most interesting dwellings in this country, as the painter knows, are\\r\\nthe most unpretending, humble log huts and cottages of the poor commonly; it is\\r\\nthe life of the inhabitants whose shells they are, and not any peculiarity in\\r\\ntheir surfaces merely, which makes them picturesque; and equally\\r\\ninteresting will be the citizen’s suburban box, when his life shall be as\\r\\nsimple and as agreeable to the imagination, and there is as little straining\\r\\nafter effect in the style of his dwelling. A great proportion of architectural\\r\\nornaments are literally hollow, and a September gale would strip them off, like\\r\\nborrowed plumes, without injury to the substantials. They can do without\\r\\narchitecture who have no olives nor wines in the cellar. What if an\\r\\nequal ado were made about the ornaments of style in literature, and the\\r\\narchitects of our bibles spent as much time about their cornices as the\\r\\narchitects of our churches do? So are made the belles-lettres and the\\r\\nbeaux-arts and their professors. Much it concerns a man, forsooth, how a\\r\\nfew sticks are slanted over him or under him, and what colors are daubed upon\\r\\nhis box. It would signify somewhat, if, in any earnest sense, he slanted\\r\\nthem and daubed it; but the spirit having departed out of the tenant, it is of\\r\\na piece with constructing his own coffin,—the architecture of the grave,\\r\\nand “carpenter” is but another name for “coffin-maker.”\\r\\nOne man says, in his despair or indifference to life, take up a handful of the\\r\\nearth at your feet, and paint your house that color. Is he thinking of his last\\r\\nand narrow house? Toss up a copper for it as well. What an abundance of leisure\\r\\nhe must have! Why do you take up a handful of dirt? Better paint your house\\r\\nyour own complexion; let it turn pale or blush for you. An enterprise to\\r\\nimprove the style of cottage architecture! When you have got my ornaments\\r\\nready I will wear them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBefore winter I built a chimney, and shingled the sides of my house, which were\\r\\nalready impervious to rain, with imperfect and sappy shingles made of the first\\r\\nslice of the log, whose edges I was obliged to straighten with a plane.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have thus a tight shingled and plastered house, ten feet wide by fifteen\\r\\nlong, and eight-feet posts, with a garret and a closet, a large window on each\\r\\nside, two trap doors, one door at the end, and a brick fireplace opposite. The\\r\\nexact cost of my house, paying the usual price for such materials as I used,\\r\\nbut not counting the work, all of which was done by myself, was as follows; and\\r\\nI give the details because very few are able to tell exactly what their houses\\r\\ncost, and fewer still, if any, the separate cost of the various materials which\\r\\ncompose them:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n    Boards.......................... $ 8.03Â½, mostly shanty boards.\\r\\n    Refuse shingles for roof sides,..  4.00\\r\\n    Laths,...........................  1.25\\r\\n    Two second-hand windows\\r\\n       with glass,...................  2.43\\r\\n    One thousand old brick,..........  4.00\\r\\n    Two casks of lime,...............  2.40  That was high.\\r\\n    Hair,............................  0.31  More than I needed.\\r\\n    Mantle-tree iron,................  0.15\\r\\n    Nails,...........................  3.90\\r\\n    Hinges and screws,...............  0.14\\r\\n    Latch,...........................  0.10\\r\\n    Chalk,...........................  0.01\\r\\n    Transportation,..................  1.40  I carried a good part\\r\\n                                     ———— on my back.\\r\\n        In all,..................... $28.12Â½\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThese are all the materials excepting the timber stones and sand, which I\\r\\nclaimed by squatter’s right. I have also a small wood-shed adjoining,\\r\\nmade chiefly of the stuff which was left after building the house.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI intend to build me a house which will surpass any on the main street in\\r\\nConcord in grandeur and luxury, as soon as it pleases me as much and will cost\\r\\nme no more than my present one.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI thus found that the student who wishes for a shelter can obtain one for a\\r\\nlifetime at an expense not greater than the rent which he now pays annually. If\\r\\nI seem to boast more than is becoming, my excuse is that I brag for humanity\\r\\nrather than for myself; and my shortcomings and inconsistencies do not affect\\r\\nthe truth of my statement. Notwithstanding much cant and hypocrisy,—chaff\\r\\nwhich I find it difficult to separate from my wheat, but for which I am as\\r\\nsorry as any man,—I will breathe freely and stretch myself in this\\r\\nrespect, it is such a relief to both the moral and physical system; and I am\\r\\nresolved that I will not through humility become the devil’s attorney. I\\r\\nwill endeavor to speak a good word for the truth. At Cambridge College the mere\\r\\nrent of a student’s room, which is only a little larger than my own, is\\r\\nthirty dollars each year, though the corporation had the advantage of building\\r\\nthirty-two side by side and under one roof, and the occupant suffers the\\r\\ninconvenience of many and noisy neighbors, and perhaps a residence in the\\r\\nfourth story. I cannot but think that if we had more true wisdom in these\\r\\nrespects, not only less education would be needed, because, forsooth, more\\r\\nwould already have been acquired, but the pecuniary expense of getting an\\r\\neducation would in a great measure vanish. Those conveniences which the student\\r\\nrequires at Cambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody else ten times as great\\r\\na sacrifice of life as they would with proper management on both sides. Those\\r\\nthings for which the most money is demanded are never the things which the\\r\\nstudent most wants. Tuition, for instance, is an important item in the term\\r\\nbill, while for the far more valuable education which he gets by associating\\r\\nwith the most cultivated of his contemporaries no charge is made. The mode of\\r\\nfounding a college is, commonly, to get up a subscription of dollars and cents,\\r\\nand then following blindly the principles of a division of labor to its\\r\\nextreme, a principle which should never be followed but with\\r\\ncircumspection,—to call in a contractor who makes this a subject of\\r\\nspeculation, and he employs Irishmen or other operatives actually to lay the\\r\\nfoundations, while the students that are to be are said to be fitting\\r\\nthemselves for it; and for these oversights successive generations have to pay.\\r\\nI think that it would be better than this, for the students, or those\\r\\nwho desire to be benefited by it, even to lay the foundation themselves. The\\r\\nstudent who secures his coveted leisure and retirement by systematically\\r\\nshirking any labor necessary to man obtains but an ignoble and unprofitable\\r\\nleisure, defrauding himself of the experience which alone can make leisure\\r\\nfruitful. “But,” says one, “you do not mean that the students\\r\\nshould go to work with their hands instead of their heads?” I do not mean\\r\\nthat exactly, but I mean something which he might think a good deal like that;\\r\\nI mean that they should not play life, or study it merely, while\\r\\nthe community supports them at this expensive game, but earnestly live\\r\\nit from beginning to end. How could youths better learn to live than by at once\\r\\ntrying the experiment of living? Methinks this would exercise their minds as\\r\\nmuch as mathematics. If I wished a boy to know something about the arts and\\r\\nsciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is merely\\r\\nto send him into the neighborhood of some professor, where any thing is\\r\\nprofessed and practised but the art of life;—to survey the world through\\r\\na telescope or a microscope, and never with his natural eye; to study\\r\\nchemistry, and not learn how his bread is made, or mechanics, and not learn how\\r\\nit is earned; to discover new satellites to Neptune, and not detect the motes\\r\\nin his eyes, or to what vagabond he is a satellite himself; or to be devoured\\r\\nby the monsters that swarm all around him, while contemplating the monsters in\\r\\na drop of vinegar. Which would have advanced the most at the end of a\\r\\nmonth,—the boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which he had\\r\\ndug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for this,—or the\\r\\nboy who had attended the lectures on metallurgy at the Institute in the mean\\r\\nwhile, and had received a Rodgers’ penknife from his father? Which would\\r\\nbe most likely to cut his fingers?... To my astonishment I was informed on\\r\\nleaving college that I had studied navigation!—why, if I had taken one\\r\\nturn down the harbor I should have known more about it. Even the poor\\r\\nstudent studies and is taught only political economy, while that economy\\r\\nof living which is synonymous with philosophy is not even sincerely professed\\r\\nin our colleges. The consequence is, that while he is reading Adam Smith,\\r\\nRicardo, and Say, he runs his father in debt irretrievably.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs with our colleges, so with a hundred “modern improvements”;\\r\\nthere is an illusion about them; there is not always a positive advance. The\\r\\ndevil goes on exacting compound interest to the last for his early share and\\r\\nnumerous succeeding investments in them. Our inventions are wont to be pretty\\r\\ntoys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved\\r\\nmeans to an unimproved end, an end which it was already but too easy to arrive\\r\\nat; as railroads lead to Boston or New York. We are in great haste to construct\\r\\na magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have\\r\\nnothing important to communicate. Either is in such a predicament as the man\\r\\nwho was earnest to be introduced to a distinguished deaf woman, but when he was\\r\\npresented, and one end of her ear trumpet was put into his hand, had nothing to\\r\\nsay. As if the main object were to talk fast and not to talk sensibly. We are\\r\\neager to tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the old world some weeks nearer to\\r\\nthe new; but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad,\\r\\nflapping American ear will be that the Princess Adelaide has the whooping\\r\\ncough. After all, the man whose horse trots a mile in a minute does not carry\\r\\nthe most important messages; he is not an evangelist, nor does he come round\\r\\neating locusts and wild honey. I doubt if Flying Childers ever carried a peck\\r\\nof corn to mill.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne says to me, “I wonder that you do not lay up money; you love to\\r\\ntravel; you might take the cars and go to Fitchburg to-day and see the\\r\\ncountry.” But I am wiser than that. I have learned that the swiftest\\r\\ntraveller is he that goes afoot. I say to my friend, Suppose we try who will\\r\\nget there first. The distance is thirty miles; the fare ninety cents. That is\\r\\nalmost a day’s wages. I remember when wages were sixty cents a day for\\r\\nlaborers on this very road. Well, I start now on foot, and get there before\\r\\nnight; I have travelled at that rate by the week together. You will in the\\r\\nmean while have earned your fare, and arrive there some time to-morrow, or\\r\\npossibly this evening, if you are lucky enough to get a job in season. Instead\\r\\nof going to Fitchburg, you will be working here the greater part of the day.\\r\\nAnd so, if the railroad reached round the world, I think that I should keep\\r\\nahead of you; and as for seeing the country and getting experience of that\\r\\nkind, I should have to cut your acquaintance altogether.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSuch is the universal law, which no man can ever outwit, and with regard to the\\r\\nrailroad even we may say it is as broad as it is long. To make a railroad round\\r\\nthe world available to all mankind is equivalent to grading the whole surface\\r\\nof the planet. Men have an indistinct notion that if they keep up this activity\\r\\nof joint stocks and spades long enough all will at length ride somewhere, in\\r\\nnext to no time, and for nothing; but though a crowd rushes to the depot, and\\r\\nthe conductor shouts “All aboard!” when the smoke is blown away and\\r\\nthe vapor condensed, it will be perceived that a few are riding, but the rest\\r\\nare run over,—and it will be called, and will be, “A melancholy\\r\\naccident.” No doubt they can ride at last who shall have earned their\\r\\nfare, that is, if they survive so long, but they will probably have lost their\\r\\nelasticity and desire to travel by that time. This spending of the best part of\\r\\none’s life earning money in order to enjoy a questionable liberty during\\r\\nthe least valuable part of it, reminds me of the Englishman who went to India\\r\\nto make a fortune first, in order that he might return to England and live the\\r\\nlife of a poet. He should have gone up garret at once. “What!”\\r\\nexclaim a million Irishmen starting up from all the shanties in the land,\\r\\n“is not this railroad which we have built a good thing?” Yes, I\\r\\nanswer, comparatively good, that is, you might have done worse; but I\\r\\nwish, as you are brothers of mine, that you could have spent your time better\\r\\nthan digging in this dirt.\\n\\n\\r\\nBefore I finished my house, wishing to earn ten or twelve dollars by some\\r\\nhonest and agreeable method, in order to meet my unusual expenses, I planted\\r\\nabout two acres and a half of light and sandy soil near it chiefly with beans,\\r\\nbut also a small part with potatoes, corn, peas, and turnips. The whole lot\\r\\ncontains eleven acres, mostly growing up to pines and hickories, and was sold\\r\\nthe preceding season for eight dollars and eight cents an acre. One farmer said\\r\\nthat it was “good for nothing but to raise cheeping squirrels on.”\\r\\nI put no manure whatever on this land, not being the owner, but merely a\\r\\nsquatter, and not expecting to cultivate so much again, and I did not quite hoe\\r\\nit all once. I got out several cords of stumps in ploughing, which supplied me\\r\\nwith fuel for a long time, and left small circles of virgin mould, easily\\r\\ndistinguishable through the summer by the greater luxuriance of the beans\\r\\nthere. The dead and for the most part unmerchantable wood behind my house, and\\r\\nthe driftwood from the pond, have supplied the remainder of my fuel. I was\\r\\nobliged to hire a team and a man for the ploughing, though I held the plough\\r\\nmyself. My farm outgoes for the first season were, for implements, seed, work,\\r\\n&c., $14.72Â½. The seed corn was given me. This never costs anything to\\r\\nspeak of, unless you plant more than enough. I got twelve bushels of beans, and\\r\\neighteen bushels of potatoes, beside some peas and sweet corn. The yellow corn\\r\\nand turnips were too late to come to any thing. My whole income from the farm\\r\\nwas\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n                                       $ 23.44\\r\\n      Deducting the outgoes,...........  14.72Â½\\r\\n                                         ————\\r\\n      There are left,................. $  8.71Â½,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nbeside produce consumed and on hand at the time this estimate was made of the\\r\\nvalue of $4.50,—the amount on hand much more than balancing a little\\r\\ngrass which I did not raise. All things considered, that is, considering the\\r\\nimportance of a man’s soul and of to-day, notwithstanding the short time\\r\\noccupied by my experiment, nay, partly even because of its transient character,\\r\\nI believe that that was doing better than any farmer in Concord did that year.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe next year I did better still, for I spaded up all the land which I\\r\\nrequired, about a third of an acre, and I learned from the experience of both\\r\\nyears, not being in the least awed by many celebrated works on husbandry,\\r\\nArthur Young among the rest, that if one would live simply and eat only the\\r\\ncrop which he raised, and raise no more than he ate, and not exchange it for an\\r\\ninsufficient quantity of more luxurious and expensive things, he would need to\\r\\ncultivate only a few rods of ground, and that it would be cheaper to spade up\\r\\nthat than to use oxen to plough it, and to select a fresh spot from time to\\r\\ntime than to manure the old, and he could do all his necessary farm work as it\\r\\nwere with his left hand at odd hours in the summer; and thus he would not be\\r\\ntied to an ox, or horse, or cow, or pig, as at present. I desire to speak\\r\\nimpartially on this point, and as one not interested in the success or failure\\r\\nof the present economical and social arrangements. I was more independent than\\r\\nany farmer in Concord, for I was not anchored to a house or farm, but could\\r\\nfollow the bent of my genius, which is a very crooked one, every moment. Beside\\r\\nbeing better off than they already, if my house had been burned or my crops had\\r\\nfailed, I should have been nearly as well off as before.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI am wont to think that men are not so much the keepers of herds as herds are\\r\\nthe keepers of men, the former are so much the freer. Men and oxen exchange\\r\\nwork; but if we consider necessary work only, the oxen will be seen to have\\r\\ngreatly the advantage, their farm is so much the larger. Man does some of his\\r\\npart of the exchange work in his six weeks of haying, and it is no boy’s\\r\\nplay. Certainly no nation that lived simply in all respects, that is, no nation\\r\\nof philosophers, would commit so great a blunder as to use the labor of\\r\\nanimals. True, there never was and is not likely soon to be a nation of\\r\\nphilosophers, nor am I certain it is desirable that there should be. However,\\r\\nI should never have broken a horse or bull and taken him to board for\\r\\nany work he might do for me, for fear I should become a horse-man or a\\r\\nherds-man merely; and if society seems to be the gainer by so doing, are we\\r\\ncertain that what is one man’s gain is not another’s loss, and that\\r\\nthe stable-boy has equal cause with his master to be satisfied? Granted that\\r\\nsome public works would not have been constructed without this aid, and let man\\r\\nshare the glory of such with the ox and horse; does it follow that he could not\\r\\nhave accomplished works yet more worthy of himself in that case? When men begin\\r\\nto do, not merely unnecessary or artistic, but luxurious and idle work, with\\r\\ntheir assistance, it is inevitable that a few do all the exchange work with the\\r\\noxen, or, in other words, become the slaves of the strongest. Man thus not only\\r\\nworks for the animal within him, but, for a symbol of this, he works for the\\r\\nanimal without him. Though we have many substantial houses of brick or stone,\\r\\nthe prosperity of the farmer is still measured by the degree to which the barn\\r\\novershadows the house. This town is said to have the largest houses for oxen,\\r\\ncows, and horses hereabouts, and it is not behindhand in its public buildings;\\r\\nbut there are very few halls for free worship or free speech in this county. It\\r\\nshould not be by their architecture, but why not even by their power of\\r\\nabstract thought, that nations should seek to commemorate themselves? How much\\r\\nmore admirable the Bhagvat-Geeta than all the ruins of the East! Towers and\\r\\ntemples are the luxury of princes. A simple and independent mind does not toil\\r\\nat the bidding of any prince. Genius is not a retainer to any emperor, nor is\\r\\nits material silver, or gold, or marble, except to a trifling extent. To what\\r\\nend, pray, is so much stone hammered? In Arcadia, when I was there, I did not\\r\\nsee any hammering stone. Nations are possessed with an insane ambition to\\r\\nperpetuate the memory of themselves by the amount of hammered stone they leave.\\r\\nWhat if equal pains were taken to smooth and polish their manners? One piece of\\r\\ngood sense would be more memorable than a monument as high as the moon. I love\\r\\nbetter to see stones in place. The grandeur of Thebes was a vulgar grandeur.\\r\\nMore sensible is a rod of stone wall that bounds an honest man’s field\\r\\nthan a hundred-gated Thebes that has wandered farther from the true end of\\r\\nlife. The religion and civilization which are barbaric and heathenish build\\r\\nsplendid temples; but what you might call Christianity does not. Most of the\\r\\nstone a nation hammers goes toward its tomb only. It buries itself alive. As\\r\\nfor the Pyramids, there is nothing to wonder at in them so much as the fact\\r\\nthat so many men could be found degraded enough to spend their lives\\r\\nconstructing a tomb for some ambitious booby, whom it would have been wiser and\\r\\nmanlier to have drowned in the Nile, and then given his body to the dogs. I\\r\\nmight possibly invent some excuse for them and him, but I have no time for it.\\r\\nAs for the religion and love of art of the builders, it is much the same all\\r\\nthe world over, whether the building be an Egyptian temple or the United States\\r\\nBank. It costs more than it comes to. The mainspring is vanity, assisted by the\\r\\nlove of garlic and bread and butter. Mr. Balcom, a promising young architect,\\r\\ndesigns it on the back of his Vitruvius, with hard pencil and ruler, and the\\r\\njob is let out to Dobson & Sons, stonecutters. When the thirty centuries\\r\\nbegin to look down on it, mankind begin to look up at it. As for your high\\r\\ntowers and monuments, there was a crazy fellow once in this town who undertook\\r\\nto dig through to China, and he got so far that, as he said, he heard the\\r\\nChinese pots and kettles rattle; but I think that I shall not go out of my way\\r\\nto admire the hole which he made. Many are concerned about the monuments of the\\r\\nWest and the East,—to know who built them. For my part, I should like to\\r\\nknow who in those days did not build them,—who were above such trifling.\\r\\nBut to proceed with my statistics.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy surveying, carpentry, and day-labor of various other kinds in the village in\\r\\nthe mean while, for I have as many trades as fingers, I had earned $13.34. The\\r\\nexpense of food for eight months, namely, from July 4th to March 1st, the time\\r\\nwhen these estimates were made, though I lived there more than two\\r\\nyears,—not counting potatoes, a little green corn, and some peas, which I\\r\\nhad raised, nor considering the value of what was on hand at the last\\r\\ndate, was\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n    Rice,................... $ 1.73Â½\\r\\n    Molasses,................  1.73     Cheapest form of the\\r\\n                                         saccharine.\\r\\n    Rye meal,................  1.04Â¾\\r\\n    Indian meal,.............  0.99Â¾     Cheaper than rye.\\r\\n    Pork,....................  0.22\\r\\n\\r\\n    All experiments which failed:\\r\\n    Flour,...................  0.88  Costs more than Indian meal,\\r\\n                                      both money and trouble.\\r\\n    Sugar,...................  0.80\\r\\n    Lard,....................  0.65\\r\\n    Apples,..................  0.25\\r\\n    Dried apple,.............  0.22\\r\\n    Sweet potatoes,..........  0.10\\r\\n    One pumpkin,.............  0.06\\r\\n    One watermelon,..........  0.02\\r\\n    Salt,....................  0.03\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYes, I did eat $8.74, all told; but I should not thus unblushingly publish my\\r\\nguilt, if I did not know that most of my readers were equally guilty with\\r\\nmyself, and that their deeds would look no better in print. The next year I\\r\\nsometimes caught a mess of fish for my dinner, and once I went so far as to\\r\\nslaughter a woodchuck which ravaged my bean-field,—effect his\\r\\ntransmigration, as a Tartar would say,—and devour him, partly for\\r\\nexperiment’s sake; but though it afforded me a momentary enjoyment,\\r\\nnotwithstanding a musky flavor, I saw that the longest use would not make that\\r\\na good practice, however it might seem to have your woodchucks ready dressed by\\r\\nthe village butcher.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nClothing and some incidental expenses within the same dates, though little can\\r\\nbe inferred from this item, amounted to\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n                                            $8.40Â¾\\r\\n    Oil and some household utensils,.......  2.00\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo that all the pecuniary outgoes, excepting for washing and mending, which for\\r\\nthe most part were done out of the house, and their bills have not yet been\\r\\nreceived,—and these are all and more than all the ways by which money\\r\\nnecessarily goes out in this part of the world,—were\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n    House,................................ $ 28.12Â½\\r\\n    Farm one year,.......................... 14.72Â½\\r\\n    Food eight months,......................  8.74\\r\\n    Clothing, etc., eight months,...........  8.40Â¾\\r\\n    Oil, &c., eight months,.................  2.00\\r\\n                                           ——————\\r\\n        In all,........................... $ 61.99Â¾\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI address myself now to those of my readers who have a living to get.

Nothing\\r\\nwas given me of which I have not rendered some account. It appears from the\\r\\nabove estimate, that my food alone cost me in money about twenty-seven cents a\\r\\nweek. It was, for nearly two years after this, rye and Indian meal without\\r\\nyeast, potatoes, rice, a very little salt pork, molasses, and salt, and my\\r\\ndrink water. It was fit that I should live on rice, mainly, who loved so well\\r\\nthe philosophy of India. To meet the objections of some inveterate cavillers, I\\r\\nmay as well state, that if I dined out occasionally, as I always had done, and\\r\\nI trust shall have opportunities to do again, it was frequently to the\\r\\ndetriment of my domestic arrangements. But the dining out, being, as I have\\r\\nstated, a constant element, does not in the least affect a comparative\\r\\nstatement like this.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI learned from my two years’ experience that it would cost incredibly\\r\\nlittle trouble to obtain one’s necessary food, even in this latitude;\\r\\nthat a man may use as simple a diet as the animals, and yet retain health and\\r\\nstrength. I have made a satisfactory dinner, satisfactory on several accounts,\\r\\nsimply off a dish of purslane (Portulaca oleracea) which I gathered in\\r\\nmy cornfield, boiled and salted. I give the Latin on account of the savoriness\\r\\nof the trivial name. And pray what more can a reasonable man desire, in\\r\\npeaceful times, in ordinary noons, than a sufficient number of ears of green\\r\\nsweet-corn boiled, with the addition of salt? Even the little variety which I\\r\\nused was a yielding to the demands of appetite, and not of health. Yet men have\\r\\ncome to such a pass that they frequently starve, not for want of necessaries,\\r\\nbut for want of luxuries; and I know a good woman who thinks that her son lost\\r\\nhis life because he took to drinking water only.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe reader will perceive that I am treating the subject rather from an economic\\r\\nthan a dietetic point of view, and he will not venture to put my abstemiousness\\r\\nto the test unless he has a well-stocked larder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBread I at first made of pure Indian meal and salt, genuine hoe-cakes, which I\\r\\nbaked before my fire out of doors on a shingle or the end of a stick of timber\\r\\nsawed off in building my house; but it was wont to get smoked and to have a\\r\\npiny flavor. I tried flour also; but have at last found a mixture of rye and\\r\\nIndian meal most convenient and agreeable. In cold weather it was no little\\r\\namusement to bake several small loaves of this in succession, tending and\\r\\nturning them as carefully as an Egyptian his hatching eggs. They were a real\\r\\ncereal fruit which I ripened, and they had to my senses a fragrance like that\\r\\nof other noble fruits, which I kept in as long as possible by wrapping them in\\r\\ncloths. I made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of bread-making,\\r\\nconsulting such authorities as offered, going back to the primitive days and\\r\\nfirst invention of the unleavened kind, when from the wildness of nuts and\\r\\nmeats men first reached the mildness and refinement of this diet, and\\r\\ntravelling gradually down in my studies through that accidental souring of the\\r\\ndough which, it is supposed, taught the leavening process, and through the\\r\\nvarious fermentations thereafter, till I came to “good, sweet, wholesome\\r\\nbread,” the staff of life. Leaven, which some deem the soul of bread, the\\r\\nspiritus which fills its cellular tissue, which is religiously preserved\\r\\nlike the vestal fire,—some precious bottle-full, I suppose, first brought\\r\\nover in the Mayflower, did the business for America, and its influence is still\\r\\nrising, swelling, spreading, in cerealian billows over the land,—this seed\\r\\nI regularly and faithfully procured from the village, till at length one\\r\\nmorning I forgot the rules, and scalded my yeast; by which accident I\\r\\ndiscovered that even this was not indispensable,—for my discoveries were\\r\\nnot by the synthetic but analytic process,—and I have gladly omitted it\\r\\nsince, though most housewives earnestly assured me that safe and wholesome\\r\\nbread without yeast might not be, and elderly people prophesied a speedy decay\\r\\nof the vital forces. Yet I find it not to be an essential ingredient, and after\\r\\ngoing without it for a year am still in the land of the living; and I am glad\\r\\nto escape the trivialness of carrying a bottle-full in my pocket, which would\\r\\nsometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture. It is simpler and\\r\\nmore respectable to omit it. Man is an animal who more than any other can adapt\\r\\nhimself to all climates and circumstances. Neither did I put any sal soda, or\\r\\nother acid or alkali, into my bread. It would seem that I made it according to\\r\\nthe recipe which Marcus Porcius Cato gave about two centuries before Christ.\\r\\n“Panem depsticium sic facito. Manus mortariumque bene lavato. Farinam in\\r\\nmortarium indito, aquÃ¦ paulatim addito, subigitoque pulchre. Ubi bene\\r\\nsubegeris, defingito, coquitoque sub testu.” Which I take to\\r\\nmean—“Make kneaded bread thus. Wash your hands and trough well.\\r\\nPut the meal into the trough, add water gradually, and knead it thoroughly.\\r\\nWhen you have kneaded it well, mould it, and bake it under a cover,” that\\r\\nis, in a baking-kettle. Not a word about leaven. But I did not always use this\\r\\nstaff of life. At one time, owing to the emptiness of my purse, I saw none of\\r\\nit for more than a month.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEvery New Englander might easily raise all his own breadstuffs in this land of\\r\\nrye and Indian corn, and not depend on distant and fluctuating markets for\\r\\nthem. Yet so far are we from simplicity and independence that, in Concord,\\r\\nfresh and sweet meal is rarely sold in the shops, and hominy and corn in a\\r\\nstill coarser form are hardly used by any. For the most part the farmer gives\\r\\nto his cattle and hogs the grain of his own producing, and buys flour, which is\\r\\nat least no more wholesome, at a greater cost, at the store. I saw that I could\\r\\neasily raise my bushel or two of rye and Indian corn, for the former will grow\\r\\non the poorest land, and the latter does not require the best, and grind them\\r\\nin a hand-mill, and so do without rice and pork; and if I must have some\\r\\nconcentrated sweet, I found by experiment that I could make a very good\\r\\nmolasses either of pumpkins or beets, and I knew that I needed only to set out\\r\\na few maples to obtain it more easily still, and while these were growing I\\r\\ncould use various substitutes beside those which I have named.\\r\\n“For,” as the Forefathers sang,—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“we can make liquor to sweeten our lips\\r\\nOf pumpkins and parsnips and walnut-tree chips.”\\n\\n\\r\\nFinally, as for salt, that grossest of groceries, to obtain this might be a fit\\r\\noccasion for a visit to the seashore, or, if I did without it altogether, I\\r\\nshould probably drink the less water. I do not learn that the Indians ever\\r\\ntroubled themselves to go after it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus I could avoid all trade and barter, so far as my food was concerned, and\\r\\nhaving a shelter already, it would only remain to get clothing and fuel. The\\r\\npantaloons which I now wear were woven in a farmer’s family,—thank\\r\\nHeaven there is so much virtue still in man; for I think the fall from the\\r\\nfarmer to the operative as great and memorable as that from the man to the\\r\\nfarmer;—and in a new country, fuel is an encumbrance. As for a habitat,\\r\\nif I were not permitted still to squat, I might purchase one acre at the same\\r\\nprice for which the land I cultivated was sold—namely, eight dollars and\\r\\neight cents. But as it was, I considered that I enhanced the value of the land\\r\\nby squatting on it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere is a certain class of unbelievers who sometimes ask me such questions as,\\r\\nif I think that I can live on vegetable food alone; and to strike at the root\\r\\nof the matter at once,—for the root is faith,—I am accustomed to\\r\\nanswer such, that I can live on board nails. If they cannot understand that,\\r\\nthey cannot understand much that I have to say. For my part, I am glad to hear\\r\\nof experiments of this kind being tried; as that a young man tried for a\\r\\nfortnight to live on hard, raw corn on the ear, using his teeth for all mortar.\\r\\nThe squirrel tribe tried the same and succeeded. The human race is interested\\r\\nin these experiments, though a few old women who are incapacitated for them, or\\r\\nwho own their thirds in mills, may be alarmed.\\n\\n\\r\\nMy furniture, part of which I made myself, and the rest cost me nothing of\\r\\nwhich I have not rendered an account, consisted of a bed, a table, a desk,\\r\\nthree chairs, a looking-glass three inches in diameter, a pair of tongs and\\r\\nandirons, a kettle, a skillet, and a frying-pan, a dipper, a wash-bowl, two\\r\\nknives and forks, three plates, one cup, one spoon, a jug for oil, a jug for\\r\\nmolasses, and a japanned lamp. None is so poor that he need sit on a pumpkin.\\r\\nThat is shiftlessness. There is a plenty of such chairs as I like best in the\\r\\nvillage garrets to be had for taking them away. Furniture! Thank God, I can sit\\r\\nand I can stand without the aid of a furniture warehouse. What man but a\\r\\nphilosopher would not be ashamed to see his furniture packed in a cart and\\r\\ngoing up country exposed to the light of heaven and the eyes of men, a beggarly\\r\\naccount of empty boxes? That is Spaulding’s furniture. I could never tell\\r\\nfrom inspecting such a load whether it belonged to a so called rich man or a\\r\\npoor one; the owner always seemed poverty-stricken. Indeed, the more you have\\r\\nof such things the poorer you are. Each load looks as if it contained the\\r\\ncontents of a dozen shanties; and if one shanty is poor, this is a dozen times\\r\\nas poor. Pray, for what do we move ever but to get rid of our furniture,\\r\\nour exuviÃ¦; at last to go from this world to another newly\\r\\nfurnished, and leave this to be burned? It is the same as if all these traps\\r\\nwere buckled to a man’s belt, and he could not move over the rough\\r\\ncountry where our lines are cast without dragging them,—dragging his trap.\\r\\nHe was a lucky fox that left his tail in the trap. The muskrat will gnaw his\\r\\nthird leg off to be free. No wonder man has lost his elasticity. How often he\\r\\nis at a dead set! “Sir, if I may be so bold, what do you mean by a dead\\r\\nset?” If you are a seer, whenever you meet a man you will see all that he\\r\\nowns, ay, and much that he pretends to disown, behind him, even to his kitchen\\r\\nfurniture and all the trumpery which he saves and will not burn, and he will\\r\\nappear to be harnessed to it and making what headway he can. I think that the\\r\\nman is at a dead set who has got through a knot hole or gateway where his\\r\\nsledge load of furniture cannot follow him. I cannot but feel compassion when I\\r\\nhear some trig, compact-looking man, seemingly free, all girded and ready,\\r\\nspeak of his “furniture,” as whether it is insured or not.\\r\\n“But what shall I do with my furniture?” My gay butterfly is\\r\\nentangled in a spider’s web then. Even those who seem for a long while\\r\\nnot to have any, if you inquire more narrowly you will find have some stored in\\r\\nsomebody’s barn. I look upon England to-day as an old gentleman who is\\r\\ntravelling with a great deal of baggage, trumpery which has accumulated from\\r\\nlong housekeeping, which he has not the courage to burn; great trunk, little\\r\\ntrunk, bandbox and bundle. Throw away the first three at least. It would\\r\\nsurpass the powers of a well man nowadays to take up his bed and walk, and I\\r\\nshould certainly advise a sick one to lay down his bed and run. When I have met\\r\\nan immigrant tottering under a bundle which contained his all—looking\\r\\nlike an enormous wen which had grown out of the nape of his neck—I have\\r\\npitied him, not because that was his all, but because he had all that to\\r\\ncarry. If I have got to drag my trap, I will take care that it be a light one\\r\\nand do not nip me in a vital part. But perchance it would be wisest never to\\r\\nput one’s paw into it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI would observe, by the way, that it costs me nothing for curtains, for I have\\r\\nno gazers to shut out but the sun and moon, and I am willing that they should\\r\\nlook in. The moon will not sour milk nor taint meat of mine, nor will the sun\\r\\ninjure my furniture or fade my carpet, and if he is sometimes too warm a\\r\\nfriend, I find it still better economy to retreat behind some curtain which\\r\\nnature has provided, than to add a single item to the details of housekeeping.\\r\\nA lady once offered me a mat, but as I had no room to spare within the house,\\r\\nnor time to spare within or without to shake it, I declined it, preferring to\\r\\nwipe my feet on the sod before my door. It is best to avoid the beginnings of\\r\\nevil.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNot long since I was present at the auction of a deacon’s effects, for\\r\\nhis life had not been ineffectual:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The evil that men do lives after them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs usual, a great proportion was trumpery which had begun to accumulate in his\\r\\nfather’s day. Among the rest was a dried tapeworm. And now, after lying\\r\\nhalf a century in his garret and other dust holes, these things were not\\r\\nburned; instead of a bonfire, or purifying destruction of them, there\\r\\nwas an auction, or increasing of them. The neighbors eagerly collected\\r\\nto view them, bought them all, and carefully transported them to their garrets\\r\\nand dust holes, to lie there till their estates are settled, when they will\\r\\nstart again. When a man dies he kicks the dust.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe customs of some savage nations might, perchance, be profitably imitated by\\r\\nus, for they at least go through the semblance of casting their slough\\r\\nannually; they have the idea of the thing, whether they have the reality or\\r\\nnot. Would it not be well if we were to celebrate such a “busk,” or\\r\\n“feast of first fruits,” as Bartram describes to have been the\\r\\ncustom of the Mucclasse Indians? “When a town celebrates the busk,”\\r\\nsays he, “having previously provided themselves with new clothes, new\\r\\npots, pans, and other household utensils and furniture, they collect all their\\r\\nworn out clothes and other despicable things, sweep and cleanse their houses,\\r\\nsquares, and the whole town of their filth, which with all the remaining grain\\r\\nand other old provisions they cast together into one common heap, and consume\\r\\nit with fire. After having taken medicine, and fasted for three days, all the\\r\\nfire in the town is extinguished. During this fast they abstain from the\\r\\ngratification of every appetite and passion whatever. A general amnesty is\\r\\nproclaimed; all malefactors may return to their town.—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On the fourth morning, the high priest, by rubbing dry wood together,\\r\\nproduces new fire in the public square, from whence every habitation in the\\r\\ntown is supplied with the new and pure flame.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey then feast on the new corn and fruits, and dance and sing for three days,\\r\\n“and the four following days they receive visits and rejoice with their\\r\\nfriends from neighboring towns who have in like manner purified and prepared\\r\\nthemselves.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Mexicans also practised a similar purification at the end of every\\r\\nfifty-two years, in the belief that it was time for the world to come to an\\r\\nend.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have scarcely heard of a truer sacrament, that is, as the dictionary defines\\r\\nit, “outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace,”\\r\\nthan this, and I have no doubt that they were originally inspired directly from\\r\\nHeaven to do thus, though they have no biblical record of the revelation.\\n\\n\\r\\nFor more than five years I maintained myself thus solely by the labor of my\\r\\nhands, and I found, that by working about six weeks in a year, I could meet all\\r\\nthe expenses of living. The whole of my winters, as well as most of my summers,\\r\\nI had free and clear for study. I have thoroughly tried school-keeping, and\\r\\nfound that my expenses were in proportion, or rather out of proportion, to my\\r\\nincome, for I was obliged to dress and train, not to say think and believe,\\r\\naccordingly, and I lost my time into the bargain. As I did not teach for the\\r\\ngood of my fellow-men, but simply for a livelihood, this was a failure. I have\\r\\ntried trade; but I found that it would take ten years to get under way in that,\\r\\nand that then I should probably be on my way to the devil. I was actually\\r\\nafraid that I might by that time be doing what is called a good business. When\\r\\nformerly I was looking about to see what I could do for a living, some sad\\r\\nexperience in conforming to the wishes of friends being fresh in my mind to tax\\r\\nmy ingenuity, I thought often and seriously of picking huckleberries; that\\r\\nsurely I could do, and its small profits might suffice,—for my greatest\\r\\nskill has been to want but little,—so little capital it required, so\\r\\nlittle distraction from my wonted moods, I foolishly thought. While my\\r\\nacquaintances went unhesitatingly into trade or the professions, I contemplated\\r\\nthis occupation as most like theirs; ranging the hills all summer to pick the\\r\\nberries which came in my way, and thereafter carelessly dispose of them; so, to\\r\\nkeep the flocks of Admetus. I also dreamed that I might gather the wild herbs,\\r\\nor carry evergreens to such villagers as loved to be reminded of the woods,\\r\\neven to the city, by hay-cart loads. But I have since learned that trade curses\\r\\neverything it handles; and though you trade in messages from heaven, the whole\\r\\ncurse of trade attaches to the business.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I preferred some things to others, and especially valued my freedom, as I\\r\\ncould fare hard and yet succeed well, I did not wish to spend my time in\\r\\nearning rich carpets or other fine furniture, or delicate cookery, or a house\\r\\nin the Grecian or the Gothic style just yet. If there are any to whom it is no\\r\\ninterruption to acquire these things, and who know how to use them when\\r\\nacquired, I relinquish to them the pursuit. Some are “industrious,”\\r\\nand appear to love labor for its own sake, or perhaps because it keeps them out\\r\\nof worse mischief; to such I have at present nothing to say. Those who would\\r\\nnot know what to do with more leisure than they now enjoy, I might advise to\\r\\nwork twice as hard as they do,—work till they pay for themselves, and get\\r\\ntheir free papers. For myself I found that the occupation of a day-laborer was\\r\\nthe most independent of any, especially as it required only thirty or forty\\r\\ndays in a year to support one. The laborer’s day ends with the going down\\r\\nof the sun, and he is then free to devote himself to his chosen pursuit,\\r\\nindependent of his labor; but his employer, who speculates from month to month,\\r\\nhas no respite from one end of the year to the other.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn short, I am convinced, both by faith and experience, that to maintain\\r\\none’s self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime, if we will live\\r\\nsimply and wisely; as the pursuits of the simpler nations are still the sports\\r\\nof the more artificial. It is not necessary that a man should earn his living\\r\\nby the sweat of his brow, unless he sweats easier than I do.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne young man of my acquaintance, who has inherited some acres, told me that he\\r\\nthought he should live as I did, if he had the means. I would not have\\r\\nany one adopt my mode of living on any account; for, beside that before\\r\\nhe has fairly learned it I may have found out another for myself, I desire that\\r\\nthere may be as many different persons in the world as possible; but I would\\r\\nhave each one be very careful to find out and pursue his own way, and\\r\\nnot his father’s or his mother’s or his neighbor’s instead.\\r\\nThe youth may build or plant or sail, only let him not be hindered from doing\\r\\nthat which he tells me he would like to do. It is by a mathematical point only\\r\\nthat we are wise, as the sailor or the fugitive slave keeps the polestar in his\\r\\neye; but that is sufficient guidance for all our life. We may not arrive at our\\r\\nport within a calculable period, but we would preserve the true course.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUndoubtedly, in this case, what is true for one is truer still for a thousand,\\r\\nas a large house is not proportionally more expensive than a small one, since\\r\\none roof may cover, one cellar underlie, and one wall separate several\\r\\napartments. But for my part, I preferred the solitary dwelling. Moreover, it\\r\\nwill commonly be cheaper to build the whole yourself than to convince another\\r\\nof the advantage of the common wall; and when you have done this, the common\\r\\npartition, to be much cheaper, must be a thin one, and that other may prove a\\r\\nbad neighbor, and also not keep his side in repair. The only coÃ¶peration which\\r\\nis commonly possible is exceedingly partial and superficial; and what little\\r\\ntrue coÃ¶peration there is, is as if it were not, being a harmony inaudible to\\r\\nmen. If a man has faith, he will coÃ¶perate with equal faith everywhere; if he\\r\\nhas not faith, he will continue to live like the rest of the world, whatever\\r\\ncompany he is joined to. To coÃ¶perate, in the highest as well as the lowest\\r\\nsense, means to get our living together. I heard it proposed lately that\\r\\ntwo young men should travel together over the world, the one without money,\\r\\nearning his means as he went, before the mast and behind the plow, the other\\r\\ncarrying a bill of exchange in his pocket. It was easy to see that they could\\r\\nnot long be companions or coÃ¶perate, since one would not operate at\\r\\nall. They would part at the first interesting crisis in their adventures. Above\\r\\nall, as I have implied, the man who goes alone can start to-day; but he who\\r\\ntravels with another must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long\\r\\ntime before they get off.\\n\\n\\r\\nBut all this is very selfish, I have heard some of my townsmen say. I confess\\r\\nthat I have hitherto indulged very little in philanthropic enterprises. I have\\r\\nmade some sacrifices to a sense of duty, and among others have sacrificed this\\r\\npleasure also. There are those who have used all their arts to persuade me to\\r\\nundertake the support of some poor family in the town; and if I had nothing to\\r\\ndo,—for the devil finds employment for the idle,—I might try my hand\\r\\nat some such pastime as that. However, when I have thought to indulge myself in\\r\\nthis respect, and lay their Heaven under an obligation by maintaining certain\\r\\npoor persons in all respects as comfortably as I maintain myself, and have even\\r\\nventured so far as to make them the offer, they have one and all unhesitatingly\\r\\npreferred to remain poor. While my townsmen and women are devoted in so many\\r\\nways to the good of their fellows, I trust that one at least may be spared to\\r\\nother and less humane pursuits. You must have a genius for charity as well as\\r\\nfor any thing else. As for Doing-good, that is one of the professions which are\\r\\nfull. Moreover, I have tried it fairly, and, strange as it may seem, am\\r\\nsatisfied that it does not agree with my constitution. Probably I should not\\r\\nconsciously and deliberately forsake my particular calling to do the good which\\r\\nsociety demands of me, to save the universe from annihilation; and I believe\\r\\nthat a like but infinitely greater steadfastness elsewhere is all that now\\r\\npreserves it. But I would not stand between any man and his genius; and to him\\r\\nwho does this work, which I decline, with his whole heart and soul and life, I\\r\\nwould say, Persevere, even if the world call it doing evil, as it is most\\r\\nlikely they will.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI am far from supposing that my case is a peculiar one; no doubt many of my\\r\\nreaders would make a similar defence. At doing something,—I will not\\r\\nengage that my neighbors shall pronounce it good,—I do not hesitate to say\\r\\nthat I should be a capital fellow to hire; but what that is, it is for my\\r\\nemployer to find out. What good I do, in the common sense of that word,\\r\\nmust be aside from my main path, and for the most part wholly unintended. Men\\r\\nsay, practically, Begin where you are and such as you are, without aiming\\r\\nmainly to become of more worth, and with kindness aforethought go about doing\\r\\ngood. If I were to preach at all in this strain, I should say rather, Set about\\r\\nbeing good. As if the sun should stop when he had kindled his fires up to the\\r\\nsplendor of a moon or a star of the sixth magnitude, and go about like a Robin\\r\\nGoodfellow, peeping in at every cottage window, inspiring lunatics, and\\r\\ntainting meats, and making darkness visible, instead of steadily increasing his\\r\\ngenial heat and beneficence till he is of such brightness that no mortal can\\r\\nlook him in the face, and then, and in the mean while too, going about the world\\r\\nin his own orbit, doing it good, or rather, as a truer philosophy has\\r\\ndiscovered, the world going about him getting good. When Phaeton, wishing to\\r\\nprove his heavenly birth by his beneficence, had the sun’s chariot but\\r\\none day, and drove out of the beaten track, he burned several blocks of houses\\r\\nin the lower streets of heaven, and scorched the surface of the earth, and\\r\\ndried up every spring, and made the great desert of Sahara, till at length\\r\\nJupiter hurled him headlong to the earth with a thunderbolt, and the sun,\\r\\nthrough grief at his death, did not shine for a year.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted. It is\\r\\nhuman, it is divine, carrion. If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming\\r\\nto my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my\\r\\nlife, as from that dry and parching wind of the African deserts called the\\r\\nsimoom, which fills the mouth and nose and ears and eyes with dust till you are\\r\\nsuffocated, for fear that I should get some of his good done to me,—some\\r\\nof its virus mingled with my blood. No,—in this case I would rather\\r\\nsuffer evil the natural way. A man is not a good man to me because he\\r\\nwill feed me if I should be starving, or warm me if I should be freezing, or\\r\\npull me out of a ditch if I should ever fall into one. I can find you a\\r\\nNewfoundland dog that will do as much. Philanthropy is not love for one’s\\r\\nfellow-man in the broadest sense. Howard was no doubt an exceedingly kind and\\r\\nworthy man in his way, and has his reward; but, comparatively speaking, what\\r\\nare a hundred Howards to us, if their philanthropy do not help us\\r\\nin our best estate, when we are most worthy to be helped? I never heard of a\\r\\nphilanthropic meeting in which it was sincerely proposed to do any good to me,\\r\\nor the like of me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Jesuits were quite balked by those Indians who, being burned at the stake,\\r\\nsuggested new modes of torture to their tormentors. Being superior to physical\\r\\nsuffering, it sometimes chanced that they were superior to any consolation\\r\\nwhich the missionaries could offer; and the law to do as you would be done by\\r\\nfell with less persuasiveness on the ears of those who, for their part, did not\\r\\ncare how they were done by, who loved their enemies after a new fashion, and\\r\\ncame very near freely forgiving them all they did.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBe sure that you give the poor the aid they most need, though it be your\\r\\nexample which leaves them far behind. If you give money, spend yourself with\\r\\nit, and do not merely abandon it to them. We make curious mistakes sometimes.\\r\\nOften the poor man is not so cold and hungry as he is dirty and ragged and\\r\\ngross. It is partly his taste, and not merely his misfortune. If you give him\\r\\nmoney, he will perhaps buy more rags with it. I was wont to pity the clumsy\\r\\nIrish laborers who cut ice on the pond, in such mean and ragged clothes, while\\r\\nI shivered in my more tidy and somewhat more fashionable garments, till, one\\r\\nbitter cold day, one who had slipped into the water came to my house to warm\\r\\nhim, and I saw him strip off three pairs of pants and two pairs of stockings\\r\\nere he got down to the skin, though they were dirty and ragged enough, it is\\r\\ntrue, and that he could afford to refuse the extra garments which I\\r\\noffered him, he had so many intra ones. This ducking was the very thing\\r\\nhe needed. Then I began to pity myself, and I saw that it would be a greater\\r\\ncharity to bestow on me a flannel shirt than a whole slop-shop on him. There\\r\\nare a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the\\r\\nroot, and it may be that he who bestows the largest amount of time and money on\\r\\nthe needy is doing the most by his mode of life to produce that misery which he\\r\\nstrives in vain to relieve. It is the pious slave-breeder devoting the proceeds\\r\\nof every tenth slave to buy a Sunday’s liberty for the rest. Some show\\r\\ntheir kindness to the poor by employing them in their kitchens. Would they not\\r\\nbe kinder if they employed themselves there? You boast of spending a tenth part\\r\\nof your income in charity; maybe you should spend the nine tenths so, and done\\r\\nwith it. Society recovers only a tenth part of the property then. Is this owing\\r\\nto the generosity of him in whose possession it is found, or to the remissness\\r\\nof the officers of justice?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPhilanthropy is almost the only virtue which is sufficiently appreciated by\\r\\nmankind. Nay, it is greatly overrated; and it is our selfishness which\\r\\noverrates it. A robust poor man, one sunny day here in Concord, praised a\\r\\nfellow-townsman to me, because, as he said, he was kind to the poor; meaning\\r\\nhimself. The kind uncles and aunts of the race are more esteemed than its true\\r\\nspiritual fathers and mothers. I once heard a reverend lecturer on England, a\\r\\nman of learning and intelligence, after enumerating her scientific, literary,\\r\\nand political worthies, Shakespeare, Bacon, Cromwell, Milton, Newton, and\\r\\nothers, speak next of her Christian heroes, whom, as if his profession required\\r\\nit of him, he elevated to a place far above all the rest, as the greatest of\\r\\nthe great. They were Penn, Howard, and Mrs. Fry. Every one must feel the\\r\\nfalsehood and cant of this. The last were not England’s best men and\\r\\nwomen; only, perhaps, her best philanthropists.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI would not subtract any thing from the praise that is due to philanthropy, but\\r\\nmerely demand justice for all who by their lives and works are a blessing to\\r\\nmankind. I do not value chiefly a man’s uprightness and benevolence,\\r\\nwhich are, as it were, his stem and leaves. Those plants of whose greenness\\r\\nwithered we make herb tea for the sick, serve but a humble use, and are most\\r\\nemployed by quacks. I want the flower and fruit of a man; that some fragrance\\r\\nbe wafted over from him to me, and some ripeness flavor our intercourse. His\\r\\ngoodness must not be a partial and transitory act, but a constant superfluity,\\r\\nwhich costs him nothing and of which he is unconscious. This is a charity that\\r\\nhides a multitude of sins. The philanthropist too often surrounds mankind with\\r\\nthe remembrance of his own cast-off griefs as an atmosphere, and calls it\\r\\nsympathy. We should impart our courage, and not our despair, our health and\\r\\nease, and not our disease, and take care that this does not spread by\\r\\ncontagion. From what southern plains comes up the voice of wailing? Under what\\r\\nlatitudes reside the heathen to whom we would send light? Who is that\\r\\nintemperate and brutal man whom we would redeem? If any thing ail a man, so that\\r\\nhe does not perform his functions, if he have a pain in his bowels\\r\\neven,—for that is the seat of sympathy,—he forthwith sets about\\r\\nreforming—the world. Being a microcosm himself, he discovers, and it\\r\\nis a true discovery, and he is the man to make it,—that the world has been\\r\\neating green apples; to his eyes, in fact, the globe itself is a great green\\r\\napple, which there is danger awful to think of that the children of men will\\r\\nnibble before it is ripe; and straightway his drastic philanthropy seeks out\\r\\nthe Esquimaux and the Patagonian, and embraces the populous Indian and Chinese\\r\\nvillages; and thus, by a few years of philanthropic activity, the powers in the\\r\\nmean while using him for their own ends, no doubt, he cures himself of his\\r\\ndyspepsia, the globe acquires a faint blush on one or both of its cheeks, as if\\r\\nit were beginning to be ripe, and life loses its crudity and is once more sweet\\r\\nand wholesome to live. I never dreamed of any enormity greater than I have\\r\\ncommitted. I never knew, and never shall know, a worse man than myself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI believe that what so saddens the reformer is not his sympathy with his\\r\\nfellows in distress, but, though he be the holiest son of God, is his private\\r\\nail. Let this be righted, let the spring come to him, the morning rise over his\\r\\ncouch, and he will forsake his generous companions without apology. My excuse\\r\\nfor not lecturing against the use of tobacco is, that I never chewed it; that\\r\\nis a penalty which reformed tobacco-chewers have to pay; though there are\\r\\nthings enough I have chewed, which I could lecture against. If you should ever\\r\\nbe betrayed into any of these philanthropies, do not let your left hand know\\r\\nwhat your right hand does, for it is not worth knowing. Rescue the drowning and\\r\\ntie your shoe-strings. Take your time, and set about some free labor.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur manners have been corrupted by communication with the saints. Our\\r\\nhymn-books resound with a melodious cursing of God and enduring him forever.\\r\\nOne would say that even the prophets and redeemers had rather consoled the\\r\\nfears than confirmed the hopes of man. There is nowhere recorded a simple and\\r\\nirrepressible satisfaction with the gift of life, any memorable praise of God.\\r\\nAll health and success does me good, however far off and withdrawn it may\\r\\nappear; all disease and failure helps to make me sad and does me evil, however\\r\\nmuch sympathy it may have with me or I with it. If, then, we would indeed\\r\\nrestore mankind by truly Indian, botanic, magnetic, or natural means, let us\\r\\nfirst be as simple and well as Nature ourselves, dispel the clouds which hang\\r\\nover our own brows, and take up a little life into our pores. Do not stay to be\\r\\nan overseer of the poor, but endeavor to become one of the worthies of the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI read in the Gulistan, or Flower Garden, of Sheik Sadi of Shiraz, that\\r\\n“They asked a wise man, saying; Of the many celebrated trees which the\\r\\nMost High God has created lofty and umbrageous, they call none azad, or free,\\r\\nexcepting the cypress, which bears no fruit; what mystery is there in this? He\\r\\nreplied; Each has its appropriate produce, and appointed season, during the\\r\\ncontinuance of which it is fresh and blooming, and during their absence dry and\\r\\nwithered; to neither of which states is the cypress exposed, being always\\r\\nflourishing; and of this nature are the azads, or religious\\r\\nindependents.—Fix not thy heart on that which is transitory; for the\\r\\nDijlah, or Tigris, will continue to flow through Bagdad after the race of\\r\\ncaliphs is extinct: if thy hand has plenty, be liberal as the date tree; but if\\r\\nit affords nothing to give away, be an azad, or free man, like the\\r\\ncypress.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCOMPLEMENTAL VERSES\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pretensions of Poverty\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thou dost presume too much, poor needy wretch,\\r\\nTo claim a station in the firmament\\r\\nBecause thy humble cottage, or thy tub,\\r\\nNurses some lazy or pedantic virtue\\r\\nIn the cheap sunshine or by shady springs,\\r\\nWith roots and pot-herbs; where thy right hand,\\r\\nTearing those humane passions from the mind,\\r\\nUpon whose stocks fair blooming virtues flourish,\\r\\nDegradeth nature, and benumbeth sense,\\r\\nAnd, Gorgon-like, turns active men to stone.\\r\\nWe not require the dull society\\r\\nOf your necessitated temperance,\\r\\nOr that unnatural stupidity\\r\\nThat knows nor joy nor sorrow; nor your forc’d\\r\\nFalsely exalted passive fortitude\\r\\nAbove the active. This low abject brood,\\r\\nThat fix their seats in mediocrity,\\r\\nBecome your servile minds; but we advance\\r\\nSuch virtues only as admit excess,\\r\\nBrave, bounteous acts, regal magnificence,\\r\\nAll-seeing prudence, magnanimity\\r\\nThat knows no bound, and that heroic virtue\\r\\nFor which antiquity hath left no name,\\r\\nBut patterns only, such as Hercules,\\r\\nAchilles, Theseus.  Back to thy loath’d cell;\\r\\nAnd when thou seest the new enlightened sphere,\\r\\nStudy to know but what those worthies were.”\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0T. CAREW\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Where I Lived, and What I Lived For\\n\\r\\nAt a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider every spot as the\\r\\npossible site of a house. I have thus surveyed the country on every side within\\r\\na dozen miles of where I live. In imagination I have bought all the farms in\\r\\nsuccession, for all were to be bought, and I knew their price. I walked over\\r\\neach farmer’s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry\\r\\nwith him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my\\r\\nmind; even put a higher price on it,—took everything but a deed of\\r\\nit,—took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk,—cultivated\\r\\nit, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it\\r\\nlong enough, leaving him to carry it on. This experience entitled me to be\\r\\nregarded as a sort of real-estate broker by my friends. Wherever I sat, there I\\r\\nmight live, and the landscape radiated from me accordingly. What is a house but\\r\\na sedes, a seat?—better if a country seat. I discovered many a\\r\\nsite for a house not likely to be soon improved, which some might have thought\\r\\ntoo far from the village, but to my eyes the village was too far from it. Well,\\r\\nthere I might live, I said; and there I did live, for an hour, a summer and a\\r\\nwinter life; saw how I could let the years run off, buffet the winter through,\\r\\nand see the spring come in. The future inhabitants of this region, wherever\\r\\nthey may place their houses, may be sure that they have been anticipated. An\\r\\nafternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and\\r\\nto decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door, and\\r\\nwhence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and then I let it\\r\\nlie, fallow perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things\\r\\nwhich he can afford to let alone.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several\\r\\nfarms,—the refusal was all I wanted,—but I never got my fingers\\r\\nburned by actual possession. The nearest that I came to actual possession was\\r\\nwhen I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and\\r\\ncollected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off\\r\\nwith; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife—every man has\\r\\nsuch a wife—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten\\r\\ndollars to release him. Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten cents in the\\r\\nworld, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who had ten\\r\\ncents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all together. However, I let him\\r\\nkeep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or\\r\\nrather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and,\\r\\nas he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my\\r\\nten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left. I found thus that I\\r\\nhad been a rich man without any damage to my poverty. But I retained the\\r\\nlandscape, and I have since annually carried off what it yielded without a\\r\\nwheelbarrow. With respect to landscapes,—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am monarch of all I survey,\\r\\nMy right there is none to dispute.”\\n\\n\\r\\nI have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the most valuable part\\r\\nof a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that he had got a few wild apples\\r\\nonly. Why, the owner does not know it for many years when a poet has put his\\r\\nfarm in rhyme, the most admirable kind of invisible fence, has fairly impounded\\r\\nit, milked it, skimmed it, and got all the cream, and left the farmer only the\\r\\nskimmed milk.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were; its complete\\r\\nretirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the\\r\\nnearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding\\r\\non the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the\\r\\nspring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the\\r\\nhouse and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between\\r\\nme and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by\\r\\nrabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the\\r\\nrecollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house\\r\\nwas concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the\\r\\nhouse-dog bark. I was in haste to buy it, before the proprietor finished\\r\\ngetting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees, and grubbing up\\r\\nsome young birches which had sprung up in the pasture, or, in short, had made\\r\\nany more of his improvements. To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it\\r\\non; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders,—I never heard what\\r\\ncompensation he received for that,—and do all those things which had no\\r\\nother motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my\\r\\npossession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most\\r\\nabundant crop of the kind I wanted if I could only afford to let it alone. But\\r\\nit turned out as I have said.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAll that I could say, then, with respect to farming on a large scale, (I have\\r\\nalways cultivated a garden,) was, that I had had my seeds ready. Many think\\r\\nthat seeds improve with age. I have no doubt that time discriminates between\\r\\nthe good and the bad; and when at last I shall plant, I shall be less likely to\\r\\nbe disappointed. But I would say to my fellows, once for all, As long as\\r\\npossible live free and uncommitted. It makes but little difference whether you\\r\\nare committed to a farm or the county jail.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOld Cato, whose “De Re RusticÃ¢” is my “Cultivator,”\\r\\nsays, and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the\\r\\npassage, “When you think of getting a farm, turn it thus in your\\r\\nmind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think\\r\\nit enough to go round it once. The oftener you go there the more it will please\\r\\nyou, if it is good.” I think I shall not buy greedily, but go round and\\r\\nround it as long as I live, and be buried in it first, that it may please me\\r\\nthe more at last.\\n\\n\\r\\nThe present was my next experiment of this kind, which I purpose to describe\\r\\nmore at length; for convenience, putting the experience of two years into one.\\r\\nAs I have said, I do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as\\r\\nlustily as chanticleer in the morning, standing on his roost, if only to wake\\r\\nmy neighbors up.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights\\r\\nas well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the\\r\\nFourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a\\r\\ndefence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of\\r\\nrough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night.\\r\\nThe upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it\\r\\na clean and airy look, especially in the morning, when its timbers were\\r\\nsaturated with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude\\r\\nfrom them. To my imagination it retained throughout the day more or less of\\r\\nthis auroral character, reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which I\\r\\nhad visited the year before. This was an airy and unplastered cabin, fit to\\r\\nentertain a travelling god, and where a goddess might trail her garments. The\\r\\nwinds which passed over my dwelling were such as sweep over the ridges of\\r\\nmountains, bearing the broken strains, or celestial parts only, of terrestrial\\r\\nmusic. The morning wind forever blows, the poem of creation is uninterrupted;\\r\\nbut few are the ears that hear it. Olympus is but the outside of the earth\\r\\nevery where.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe only house I had been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was a tent,\\r\\nwhich I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer, and this is\\r\\nstill rolled up in my garret; but the boat, after passing from hand to hand,\\r\\nhas gone down the stream of time. With this more substantial shelter about me,\\r\\nI had made some progress toward settling in the world. This frame, so slightly\\r\\nclad, was a sort of crystallization around me, and reacted on the builder. It\\r\\nwas suggestive somewhat as a picture in outlines. I did not need to go outdoors\\r\\nto take the air, for the atmosphere within had lost none of its freshness. It\\r\\nwas not so much within doors as behind a door where I sat, even in the rainiest\\r\\nweather. The Harivansa says, “An abode without birds is like a meat\\r\\nwithout seasoning.” Such was not my abode, for I found myself suddenly\\r\\nneighbor to the birds; not by having imprisoned one, but having caged myself\\r\\nnear them. I was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the\\r\\ngarden and the orchard, but to those wilder and more thrilling songsters of\\r\\nthe forest which never, or rarely, serenade a villager,—the wood-thrush,\\r\\nthe veery, the scarlet tanager, the field-sparrow, the whippoorwill, and many\\r\\nothers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the\\r\\nvillage of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive\\r\\nwood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only\\r\\nfield known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that\\r\\nthe opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my\\r\\nmost distant horizon. For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it\\r\\nimpressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far\\r\\nabove the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off\\r\\nits nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples\\r\\nor its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts,\\r\\nwere stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the\\r\\nbreaking up of some nocturnal conventicle. The very dew seemed to hang upon the\\r\\ntrees later into the day than usual, as on the sides of mountains.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle\\r\\nrain storm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the\\r\\nsky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the\\r\\nwood-thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore. A lake like this is\\r\\nnever smoother than at such a time; and the clear portion of the air above it\\r\\nbeing shallow and darkened by clouds, the water, full of light and\\r\\nreflections, becomes a lower heaven itself so much the more important. From a\\r\\nhill top near by, where the wood had been recently cut off, there was a\\r\\npleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the\\r\\nhills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward\\r\\neach other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded\\r\\nvalley, but stream there was none. That way I looked between and over the near\\r\\ngreen hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with blue.\\r\\nIndeed, by standing on tiptoe I could catch a glimpse of some of the peaks of\\r\\nthe still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the north-west, those\\r\\ntrue-blue coins from heaven’s own mint, and also of some portion of the\\r\\nvillage. But in other directions, even from this point, I could not see over or\\r\\nbeyond the woods which surrounded me. It is well to have some water in your\\r\\nneighborhood, to give buoyancy to and float the earth. One value even of the\\r\\nsmallest well is, that when you look into it you see that earth is not\\r\\ncontinent but insular. This is as important as that it keeps butter cool. When\\r\\nI looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in\\r\\ntime of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething\\r\\nvalley, like a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a\\r\\nthin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting\\r\\nwater, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThough the view from my door was still more contracted, I did not feel crowded\\r\\nor confined in the least. There was pasture enough for my imagination. The low\\r\\nshrub-oak plateau to which the opposite shore arose, stretched away toward the\\r\\nprairies of the West and the steppes of Tartary, affording ample room for all\\r\\nthe roving families of men. “There are none happy in the world but beings\\r\\nwho enjoy freely a vast horizon,”—said Damodara, when his herds\\r\\nrequired new and larger pastures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBoth place and time were changed, and I dwelt nearer to those parts of the\\r\\nuniverse and to those eras in history which had most attracted me. Where I\\r\\nlived was as far off as many a region viewed nightly by astronomers. We are\\r\\nwont to imagine rare and delectable places in some remote and more celestial\\r\\ncorner of the system, behind the constellation of Cassiopeia’s Chair, far\\r\\nfrom noise and disturbance. I discovered that my house actually had its site in\\r\\nsuch a withdrawn, but forever new and unprofaned, part of the universe. If it\\r\\nwere worth the while to settle in those parts near to the Pleiades or the\\r\\nHyades, to Aldebaran or Altair, then I was really there, or at an equal\\r\\nremoteness from the life which I had left behind, dwindled and twinkling with\\r\\nas fine a ray to my nearest neighbor, and to be seen only in moonless nights by\\r\\nhim. Such was that part of creation where I had squatted;—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There was a shepherd that did live,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0And held his thoughts as high\\r\\nAs were the mounts whereon his flocks\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Did hourly feed him by.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhat should we think of the shepherd’s life if his flocks always wandered\\r\\nto higher pastures than his thoughts?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEvery morning was a cheerful invitation to make my life of equal simplicity,\\r\\nand I may say innocence, with Nature herself. I have been as sincere a\\r\\nworshipper of Aurora as the Greeks. I got up early and bathed in the pond; that\\r\\nwas a religious exercise, and one of the best things which I did. They say that\\r\\ncharacters were engraven on the bathing tub of king Tching-thang to this effect:\\r\\n“Renew thyself completely each day; do it again, and again, and forever\\r\\nagain.” I can understand that. Morning brings back the heroic ages. I was\\r\\nas much affected by the faint hum of a mosquito making its invisible and\\r\\nunimaginable tour through my apartment at earliest dawn, when I was sitting\\r\\nwith door and windows open, as I could be by any trumpet that ever sang of\\r\\nfame. It was Homer’s requiem; itself an Iliad and Odyssey in the air,\\r\\nsinging its own wrath and wanderings. There was something cosmical about it; a\\r\\nstanding advertisement, till forbidden, of the everlasting vigor and fertility\\r\\nof the world. The morning, which is the most memorable season of the day, is\\r\\nthe awakening hour. Then there is least somnolence in us; and for an hour, at\\r\\nleast, some part of us awakes which slumbers all the rest of the day and night.\\r\\nLittle is to be expected of that day, if it can be called a day, to which we\\r\\nare not awakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudgings of some\\r\\nservitor, are not awakened by our own newly-acquired force and aspirations from\\r\\nwithin, accompanied by the undulations of celestial music, instead of factory\\r\\nbells, and a fragrance filling the air—to a higher life than we fell\\r\\nasleep from; and thus the darkness bear its fruit, and prove itself to be good,\\r\\nno less than the light. That man who does not believe that each day contains an\\r\\nearlier, more sacred, and auroral hour than he has yet profaned, has despaired\\r\\nof life, and is pursuing a descending and darkening way. After a partial\\r\\ncessation of his sensuous life, the soul of man, or its organs rather, are\\r\\nreinvigorated each day, and his Genius tries again what noble life it can make.\\r\\nAll memorable events, I should say, transpire in morning time and in a morning\\r\\natmosphere. The Vedas say, “All intelligences awake with the\\r\\nmorning.” Poetry and art, and the fairest and most memorable of the\\r\\nactions of men, date from such an hour. All poets and heroes, like Memnon, are\\r\\nthe children of Aurora, and emit their music at sunrise. To him whose elastic\\r\\nand vigorous thought keeps pace with the sun, the day is a perpetual morning.\\r\\nIt matters not what the clocks say or the attitudes and labors of men. Morning\\r\\nis when I am awake and there is a dawn in me. Moral reform is the effort to\\r\\nthrow off sleep. Why is it that men give so poor an account of their day if\\r\\nthey have not been slumbering? They are not such poor calculators. If they had\\r\\nnot been overcome with drowsiness, they would have performed something. The\\r\\nmillions are awake enough for physical labor; but only one in a million is\\r\\nawake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred\\r\\nmillions to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive. I have never\\r\\nyet met a man who was quite awake. How could I have looked him in the face?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical aids, but\\r\\nby an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not forsake us in our\\r\\nsoundest sleep. I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable\\r\\nability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor. It is something to\\r\\nbe able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a\\r\\nfew objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very\\r\\natmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do. To affect\\r\\nthe quality of the day, that is the highest of arts. Every man is tasked to\\r\\nmake his life, even in its details, worthy of the contemplation of his most\\r\\nelevated and critical hour. If we refused, or rather used up, such paltry\\r\\ninformation as we get, the oracles would distinctly inform us how this might be\\r\\ndone.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the\\r\\nessential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and\\r\\nnot, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live\\r\\nwhat was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation,\\r\\nunless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the\\r\\nmarrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that\\r\\nwas not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a\\r\\ncorner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why\\r\\nthen to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to\\r\\nthe world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give\\r\\na true account of it in my next excursion. For most men, it appears to me, are\\r\\nin a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and\\r\\nhave somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to\\r\\n“glorify God and enjoy him forever.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nStill we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were long\\r\\nago changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is error upon\\r\\nerror, and clout upon clout, and our best virtue has for its occasion a\\r\\nsuperfluous and evitable wretchedness. Our life is frittered away by detail. An\\r\\nhonest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme\\r\\ncases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity, simplicity,\\r\\nsimplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a\\r\\nthousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on\\r\\nyour thumb nail. In the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life, such are\\r\\nthe clouds and storms and quicksands and thousand-and-one items to be allowed\\r\\nfor, that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom and\\r\\nnot make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great calculator\\r\\nindeed who succeeds. Simplify, simplify. Instead of three meals a day, if it be\\r\\nnecessary eat but one; instead of a hundred dishes, five; and reduce other\\r\\nthings in proportion. Our life is like a German Confederacy, made up of petty\\r\\nstates, with its boundary forever fluctuating, so that even a German cannot\\r\\ntell you how it is bounded at any moment. The nation itself, with all its\\r\\nso called internal improvements, which, by the way are all external and\\r\\nsuperficial, is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment, cluttered\\r\\nwith furniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and heedless\\r\\nexpense, by want of calculation and a worthy aim, as the million households in\\r\\nthe land; and the only cure for it as for them is in a rigid economy, a stern\\r\\nand more than Spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose. It lives too\\r\\nfast. Men think that it is essential that the Nation have commerce, and\\r\\nexport ice, and talk through a telegraph, and ride thirty miles an hour,\\r\\nwithout a doubt, whether they do or not; but whether we should live like\\r\\nbaboons or like men, is a little uncertain. If we do not get out sleepers, and\\r\\nforge rails, and devote days and nights to the work, but go to tinkering upon\\r\\nour lives to improve them, who will build railroads? And if\\r\\nrailroads are not built, how shall we get to heaven in season? But if we stay\\r\\nat home and mind our business, who will want railroads? We do not ride on the\\r\\nrailroad; it rides upon us. Did you ever think what those sleepers are that\\r\\nunderlie the railroad? Each one is a man, an Irish-man, or a Yankee man. The\\r\\nrails are laid on them, and they are covered with sand, and the cars run\\r\\nsmoothly over them. They are sound sleepers, I assure you. And every few years\\r\\na new lot is laid down and run over; so that, if some have the pleasure of\\r\\nriding on a rail, others have the misfortune to be ridden upon. And when they\\r\\nrun over a man that is walking in his sleep, a supernumerary sleeper in the\\r\\nwrong position, and wake him up, they suddenly stop the cars, and make a hue\\r\\nand cry about it, as if this were an exception. I am glad to know that it takes\\r\\na gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their\\r\\nbeds as it is, for this is a sign that they may sometime get up again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhy should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be\\r\\nstarved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves nine, and so\\r\\nthey take a thousand stitches to-day to save nine to-morrow. As for work,\\r\\nwe haven’t any of any consequence. We have the Saint Vitus’ dance,\\r\\nand cannot possibly keep our heads still. If I should only give a few pulls at\\r\\nthe parish bell-rope, as for a fire, that is, without setting the bell, there\\r\\nis hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of Concord, notwithstanding that\\r\\npress of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning, nor a\\r\\nboy, nor a woman, I might almost say, but would forsake all and follow that\\r\\nsound, not mainly to save property from the flames, but, if we will confess the\\r\\ntruth, much more to see it burn, since burn it must, and we, be it known, did\\r\\nnot set it on fire,—or to see it put out, and have a hand in it, if that\\r\\nis done as handsomely; yes, even if it were the parish church itself. Hardly a\\r\\nman takes a half hour’s nap after dinner, but when he wakes he holds up\\r\\nhis head and asks, “What’s the news?” as if the rest of\\r\\nmankind had stood his sentinels. Some give directions to be waked every\\r\\nhalf hour, doubtless for no other purpose; and then, to pay for it, they tell\\r\\nwhat they have dreamed. After a night’s sleep the news is as\\r\\nindispensable as the breakfast. “Pray tell me any thing new that has\\r\\nhappened to a man any where on this globe,”—and he reads it over his\\r\\ncoffee and rolls, that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on the\\r\\nWachito River; never dreaming the while that he lives in the dark unfathomed\\r\\nmammoth cave of this world, and has but the rudiment of an eye himself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor my part, I could easily do without the post-office. I think that there are\\r\\nvery few important communications made through it. To speak critically, I never\\r\\nreceived more than one or two letters in my life—I wrote this some years\\r\\nago—that were worth the postage. The penny-post is, commonly, an\\r\\ninstitution through which you seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts\\r\\nwhich is so often safely offered in jest. And I am sure that I never read any\\r\\nmemorable news in a newspaper. If we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or\\r\\nkilled by accident, or one house burned, or one vessel wrecked, or one\\r\\nsteamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog\\r\\nkilled, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter,—we never need read of\\r\\nanother. One is enough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you\\r\\ncare for a myriad instances and applications? To a philosopher all news,\\r\\nas it is called, is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over\\r\\ntheir tea. Yet not a few are greedy after this gossip. There was such a rush,\\r\\nas I hear, the other day at one of the offices to learn the foreign news by the\\r\\nlast arrival, that several large squares of plate glass belonging to the\\r\\nestablishment were broken by the pressure,—news which I seriously think a\\r\\nready wit might write a twelve-month, or twelve years, beforehand with\\r\\nsufficient accuracy. As for Spain, for instance, if you know how to throw in\\r\\nDon Carlos and the Infanta, and Don Pedro and Seville and Granada, from time to\\r\\ntime in the right proportions,—they may have changed the names a little\\r\\nsince I saw the papers,—and serve up a bull-fight when other\\r\\nentertainments fail, it will be true to the letter, and give us as good an idea\\r\\nof the exact state or ruin of things in Spain as the most succinct and lucid\\r\\nreports under this head in the newspapers: and as for England, almost the last\\r\\nsignificant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649; and if\\r\\nyou have learned the history of her crops for an average year, you never need\\r\\nattend to that thing again, unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary\\r\\ncharacter. If one may judge who rarely looks into the newspapers, nothing new\\r\\ndoes ever happen in foreign parts, a French revolution not excepted.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhat news! how much more important to know what that is which was never old!\\r\\n“Kieou-he-yu (great dignitary of the state of Wei) sent a man to\\r\\nKhoung-tseu to know his news. Khoung-tseu caused the messenger to be seated\\r\\nnear him, and questioned him in these terms: What is your master doing? The\\r\\nmessenger answered with respect: My master desires to diminish the number of\\r\\nhis faults, but he cannot come to the end of them. The messenger being gone,\\r\\nthe philosopher remarked: What a worthy messenger! What a worthy\\r\\nmessenger!” The preacher, instead of vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on\\r\\ntheir day of rest at the end of the week,—for Sunday is the fit conclusion\\r\\nof an ill-spent week, and not the fresh and brave beginning of a new\\r\\none,—with this one other draggle-tail of a sermon, should shout with\\r\\nthundering voice, “Pause! Avast! Why so seeming fast, but deadly\\r\\nslow?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths, while reality is\\r\\nfabulous. If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow\\r\\nthemselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we know,\\r\\nwould be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments. If we\\r\\nrespected only what is inevitable and has a right to be, music and poetry would\\r\\nresound along the streets. When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that\\r\\nonly great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute\\r\\nexistence,—that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the\\r\\nreality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and\\r\\nslumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm\\r\\ntheir daily life of routine and habit everywhere, which still is built on\\r\\npurely illusory foundations. Children, who play life, discern its true law and\\r\\nrelations more clearly than men, who fail to live it worthily, but who think\\r\\nthat they are wiser by experience, that is, by failure. I have read in a Hindoo\\r\\nbook, that “there was a king’s son, who, being expelled in infancy\\r\\nfrom his native city, was brought up by a forester, and, growing up to maturity\\r\\nin that state, imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he\\r\\nlived. One of his father’s ministers having discovered him, revealed to\\r\\nhim what he was, and the misconception of his character was removed, and he\\r\\nknew himself to be a prince. So soul,” continues the Hindoo philosopher,\\r\\n“from the circumstances in which it is placed, mistakes its own\\r\\ncharacter, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher, and then it\\r\\nknows itself to be Brahme.” I perceive that we inhabitants of New\\r\\nEngland live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate\\r\\nthe surface of things. We think that that is which appears to be.\\r\\nIf a man should walk through this town and see only the reality, where, think\\r\\nyou, would the “Mill-dam” go to? If he should give us an account of\\r\\nthe realities he beheld there, we should not recognize the place in his\\r\\ndescription. Look at a meeting-house, or a court-house, or a jail, or a shop,\\r\\nor a dwelling-house, and say what that thing really is before a true gaze, and\\r\\nthey would all go to pieces in your account of them. Men esteem truth remote,\\r\\nin the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star, before Adam and after\\r\\nthe last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all\\r\\nthese times and places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates\\r\\nin the present moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the\\r\\nages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by\\r\\nthe perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us. The\\r\\nuniverse constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions; whether we\\r\\ntravel fast or slow, the track is laid for us. Let us spend our lives in\\r\\nconceiving then. The poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a\\r\\ndesign but some of his posterity at least could accomplish it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLet us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown off the track\\r\\nby every nutshell and mosquito’s wing that falls on the rails. Let us\\r\\nrise early and fast, or break fast, gently and without perturbation; let\\r\\ncompany come and let company go, let the bells ring and the children\\r\\ncry,—determined to make a day of it. Why should we knock under and go with\\r\\nthe stream? Let us not be upset and overwhelmed in that terrible rapid and\\r\\nwhirlpool called a dinner, situated in the meridian shallows. Weather this\\r\\ndanger and you are safe, for the rest of the way is down hill. With unrelaxed\\r\\nnerves, with morning vigor, sail by it, looking another way, tied to the mast\\r\\nlike Ulysses. If the engine whistles, let it whistle till it is hoarse for its\\r\\npains. If the bell rings, why should we run? We will consider what kind of\\r\\nmusic they are like. Let us settle ourselves, and work and wedge our feet\\r\\ndownward through the mud and slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition,\\r\\nand delusion, and appearance, that alluvion which covers the globe, through\\r\\nParis and London, through New York and Boston and Concord, through church and\\r\\nstate, through poetry and philosophy and religion, till we come to a hard\\r\\nbottom and rocks in place, which we can call reality, and say, This is,\\r\\nand no mistake; and then begin, having a point d’appui, below\\r\\nfreshet and frost and fire, a place where you might found a wall or a state, or\\r\\nset a lamp-post safely, or perhaps a gauge, not a Nilometer, but a Realometer,\\r\\nthat future ages might know how deep a freshet of shams and appearances had\\r\\ngathered from time to time. If you stand right fronting and face to face to a\\r\\nfact, you will see the sun glimmer on both its surfaces, as if it were a\\r\\ncimeter, and feel its sweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow,\\r\\nand so you will happily conclude your mortal career. Be it life or death, we\\r\\ncrave only reality. If we are really dying, let us hear the rattle in our\\r\\nthroats and feel cold in the extremities; if we are alive, let us go about our\\r\\nbusiness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTime is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it; but while I drink I\\r\\nsee the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides\\r\\naway, but eternity remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom\\r\\nis pebbly with stars. I cannot count one. I know not the first letter of the\\r\\nalphabet. I have always been regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was\\r\\nborn. The intellect is a cleaver; it discerns and rifts its way into the secret\\r\\nof things. I do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary.\\r\\nMy head is hands and feet. I feel all my best faculties concentrated in it. My\\r\\ninstinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing, as some creatures use\\r\\ntheir snout and fore-paws, and with it I would mine and burrow my way through\\r\\nthese hills. I think that the richest vein is somewhere hereabouts; so by the\\r\\ndivining-rod and thin rising vapors I judge; and here I will begin to mine.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Reading\\n\\r\\nWith a little more deliberation in the choice of their pursuits, all men would\\r\\nperhaps become essentially students and observers, for certainly their nature\\r\\nand destiny are interesting to all alike. In accumulating property for\\r\\nourselves or our posterity, in founding a family or a state, or acquiring fame\\r\\neven, we are mortal; but in dealing with truth we are immortal, and need fear\\r\\nno change nor accident. The oldest Egyptian or Hindoo philosopher raised a\\r\\ncorner of the veil from the statue of the divinity; and still the trembling\\r\\nrobe remains raised, and I gaze upon as fresh a glory as he did, since it was I\\r\\nin him that was then so bold, and it is he in me that now reviews the vision.\\r\\nNo dust has settled on that robe; no time has elapsed since that divinity was\\r\\nrevealed. That time which we really improve, or which is improvable, is neither\\r\\npast, present, nor future.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy residence was more favorable, not only to thought, but to serious reading,\\r\\nthan a university; and though I was beyond the range of the ordinary\\r\\ncirculating library, I had more than ever come within the influence of those\\r\\nbooks which circulate round the world, whose sentences were first written on\\r\\nbark, and are now merely copied from time to time on to linen paper. Says the\\r\\npoet MÃ®r Camar UddÃ®n Mast, “Being seated to run through the region of\\r\\nthe spiritual world; I have had this advantage in books. To be intoxicated by a\\r\\nsingle glass of wine; I have experienced this pleasure when I have drunk the\\r\\nliquor of the esoteric doctrines.” I kept Homer’s Iliad on my table\\r\\nthrough the summer, though I looked at his page only now and then. Incessant\\r\\nlabor with my hands, at first, for I had my house to finish and my beans to hoe\\r\\nat the same time, made more study impossible. Yet I sustained myself by the\\r\\nprospect of such reading in future. I read one or two shallow books of travel\\r\\nin the intervals of my work, till that employment made me ashamed of myself,\\r\\nand I asked where it was then that I lived.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe student may read Homer or Ã\\x86schylus in the Greek without danger of\\r\\ndissipation or luxuriousness, for it implies that he in some measure emulate\\r\\ntheir heroes, and consecrate morning hours to their pages. The heroic books,\\r\\neven if printed in the character of our mother tongue, will always be in a\\r\\nlanguage dead to degenerate times; and we must laboriously seek the meaning of\\r\\neach word and line, conjecturing a larger sense than common use permits out of\\r\\nwhat wisdom and valor and generosity we have. The modern cheap and fertile\\r\\npress, with all its translations, has done little to bring us nearer to the\\r\\nheroic writers of antiquity. They seem as solitary, and the letter in which\\r\\nthey are printed as rare and curious, as ever. It is worth the expense of\\r\\nyouthful days and costly hours, if you learn only some words of an ancient\\r\\nlanguage, which are raised out of the trivialness of the street, to be\\r\\nperpetual suggestions and provocations. It is not in vain that the farmer\\r\\nremembers and repeats the few Latin words which he has heard. Men sometimes\\r\\nspeak as if the study of the classics would at length make way for more modern\\r\\nand practical studies; but the adventurous student will always study classics,\\r\\nin whatever language they may be written and however ancient they may be. For\\r\\nwhat are the classics but the noblest recorded thoughts of man? They are the\\r\\nonly oracles which are not decayed, and there are such answers to the most\\r\\nmodern inquiry in them as Delphi and Dodona never gave. We might as well omit\\r\\nto study Nature because she is old. To read well, that is, to read true books\\r\\nin a true spirit, is a noble exercise, and one that will task the reader more\\r\\nthan any exercise which the customs of the day esteem. It requires a training\\r\\nsuch as the athletes underwent, the steady intention almost of the whole life\\r\\nto this object. Books must be read as deliberately and reservedly as they were\\r\\nwritten. It is not enough even to be able to speak the language of that nation\\r\\nby which they are written, for there is a memorable interval between the spoken\\r\\nand the written language, the language heard and the language read. The one is\\r\\ncommonly transitory, a sound, a tongue, a dialect merely, almost brutish, and\\r\\nwe learn it unconsciously, like the brutes, of our mothers. The other is the\\r\\nmaturity and experience of that; if that is our mother tongue, this is our\\r\\nfather tongue, a reserved and select expression, too significant to be heard by\\r\\nthe ear, which we must be born again in order to speak. The crowds of men who\\r\\nmerely spoke the Greek and Latin tongues in the middle ages were not\\r\\nentitled by the accident of birth to read the works of genius written in\\r\\nthose languages; for these were not written in that Greek or Latin which they\\r\\nknew, but in the select language of literature. They had not learned the nobler\\r\\ndialects of Greece and Rome, but the very materials on which they were written\\r\\nwere waste paper to them, and they prized instead a cheap contemporary\\r\\nliterature. But when the several nations of Europe had acquired distinct though\\r\\nrude written languages of their own, sufficient for the purposes of their\\r\\nrising literatures, then first learning revived, and scholars were enabled to\\r\\ndiscern from that remoteness the treasures of antiquity. What the Roman and\\r\\nGrecian multitude could not hear, after the lapse of ages a few scholars\\r\\nread, and a few scholars only are still reading it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHowever much we may admire the orator’s occasional bursts of eloquence,\\r\\nthe noblest written words are commonly as far behind or above the fleeting\\r\\nspoken language as the firmament with its stars is behind the clouds.\\r\\nThere are the stars, and they who can may read them. The astronomers\\r\\nforever comment on and observe them. They are not exhalations like our daily\\r\\ncolloquies and vaporous breath. What is called eloquence in the forum is\\r\\ncommonly found to be rhetoric in the study. The orator yields to the\\r\\ninspiration of a transient occasion, and speaks to the mob before him, to those\\r\\nwho can hear him; but the writer, whose more equable life is his\\r\\noccasion, and who would be distracted by the event and the crowd which inspire\\r\\nthe orator, speaks to the intellect and health of mankind, to all in any age\\r\\nwho can understand him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNo wonder that Alexander carried the Iliad with him on his expeditions in a\\r\\nprecious casket. A written word is the choicest of relics. It is something at\\r\\nonce more intimate with us and more universal than any other work of art. It is\\r\\nthe work of art nearest to life itself. It may be translated into every\\r\\nlanguage, and not only be read but actually breathed from all human\\r\\nlips;—not be represented on canvas or in marble only, but be carved out\\r\\nof the breath of life itself. The symbol of an ancient man’s thought\\r\\nbecomes a modern man’s speech. Two thousand summers have imparted to the\\r\\nmonuments of Grecian literature, as to her marbles, only a maturer golden and\\r\\nautumnal tint, for they have carried their own serene and celestial atmosphere\\r\\ninto all lands to protect them against the corrosion of time. Books are the\\r\\ntreasured wealth of the world and the fit inheritance of generations and\\r\\nnations. Books, the oldest and the best, stand naturally and rightfully on the\\r\\nshelves of every cottage. They have no cause of their own to plead, but while\\r\\nthey enlighten and sustain the reader his common sense will not refuse them.\\r\\nTheir authors are a natural and irresistible aristocracy in every society, and,\\r\\nmore than kings or emperors, exert an influence on mankind. When the illiterate\\r\\nand perhaps scornful trader has earned by enterprise and industry his coveted\\r\\nleisure and independence, and is admitted to the circles of wealth and fashion,\\r\\nhe turns inevitably at last to those still higher but yet inaccessible circles\\r\\nof intellect and genius, and is sensible only of the imperfection of his\\r\\nculture and the vanity and insufficiency of all his riches, and further proves\\r\\nhis good sense by the pains which he takes to secure for his children that\\r\\nintellectual culture whose want he so keenly feels; and thus it is that he\\r\\nbecomes the founder of a family.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThose who have not learned to read the ancient classics in the language in\\r\\nwhich they were written must have a very imperfect knowledge of the history of\\r\\nthe human race; for it is remarkable that no transcript of them has ever been\\r\\nmade into any modern tongue, unless our civilization itself may be regarded as\\r\\nsuch a transcript. Homer has never yet been printed in English, nor\\r\\nÃ\\x86schylus, nor Virgil even—works as refined, as solidly done, and as\\r\\nbeautiful almost as the morning itself; for later writers, say what we will of\\r\\ntheir genius, have rarely, if ever, equalled the elaborate beauty and finish\\r\\nand the lifelong and heroic literary labors of the ancients. They only talk of\\r\\nforgetting them who never knew them. It will be soon enough to forget them when\\r\\nwe have the learning and the genius which will enable us to attend to and\\r\\nappreciate them. That age will be rich indeed when those relics which we call\\r\\nClassics, and the still older and more than classic but even less known\\r\\nScriptures of the nations, shall have still further accumulated, when the\\r\\nVaticans shall be filled with Vedas and Zendavestas and Bibles, with Homers and\\r\\nDantes and Shakespeares, and all the centuries to come shall have successively\\r\\ndeposited their trophies in the forum of the world. By such a pile we may hope\\r\\nto scale heaven at last.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe works of the great poets have never yet been read by mankind, for only\\r\\ngreat poets can read them. They have only been read as the multitude read the\\r\\nstars, at most astrologically, not astronomically. Most men have learned to\\r\\nread to serve a paltry convenience, as they have learned to cipher in order to\\r\\nkeep accounts and not be cheated in trade; but of reading as a noble\\r\\nintellectual exercise they know little or nothing; yet this only is reading, in\\r\\na high sense, not that which lulls us as a luxury and suffers the nobler\\r\\nfaculties to sleep the while, but what we have to stand on tip-toe to read and\\r\\ndevote our most alert and wakeful hours to.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI think that having learned our letters we should read the best that is in\\r\\nliterature, and not be forever repeating our a b abs, and words of one\\r\\nsyllable, in the fourth or fifth classes, sitting on the lowest and foremost\\r\\nform all our lives. Most men are satisfied if they read or hear read, and\\r\\nperchance have been convicted by the wisdom of one good book, the Bible, and\\r\\nfor the rest of their lives vegetate and dissipate their faculties in what is\\r\\ncalled easy reading. There is a work in several volumes in our Circulating\\r\\nLibrary entitled Little Reading, which I thought referred to a town of that\\r\\nname which I had not been to. There are those who, like cormorants and\\r\\nostriches, can digest all sorts of this, even after the fullest dinner of meats\\r\\nand vegetables, for they suffer nothing to be wasted. If others are the\\r\\nmachines to provide this provender, they are the machines to read it. They read\\r\\nthe nine thousandth tale about Zebulon and Sephronia, and how they loved as\\r\\nnone had ever loved before, and neither did the course of their true love run\\r\\nsmooth,—at any rate, how it did run and stumble, and get up again and go\\r\\non! how some poor unfortunate got up on to a steeple, who had better never have\\r\\ngone up as far as the belfry; and then, having needlessly got him up there, the\\r\\nhappy novelist rings the bell for all the world to come together and hear, O\\r\\ndear! how he did get down again! For my part, I think that they had better\\r\\nmetamorphose all such aspiring heroes of universal noveldom into man\\r\\nweathercocks, as they used to put heroes among the constellations, and let them\\r\\nswing round there till they are rusty, and not come down at all to bother\\r\\nhonest men with their pranks. The next time the novelist rings the bell I will\\r\\nnot stir though the meeting-house burn down. “The Skip of the\\r\\nTip-Toe-Hop, a Romance of the Middle Ages, by the celebrated author of\\r\\n‘Tittle-Tol-Tan,’ to appear in monthly parts; a great rush;\\r\\ndon’t all come together.” All this they read with saucer eyes, and\\r\\nerect and primitive curiosity, and with unwearied gizzard, whose corrugations\\r\\neven yet need no sharpening, just as some little four-year-old bencher his\\r\\ntwo-cent gilt-covered edition of Cinderella,—without any improvement,\\r\\nthat I can see, in the pronunciation, or accent, or emphasis, or any more skill\\r\\nin extracting or inserting the moral. The result is dulness of sight, a\\r\\nstagnation of the vital circulations, and a general deliquium and sloughing off\\r\\nof all the intellectual faculties. This sort of gingerbread is baked daily and\\r\\nmore sedulously than pure wheat or rye-and-Indian in almost every oven, and\\r\\nfinds a surer market.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe best books are not read even by those who are called good readers. What\\r\\ndoes our Concord culture amount to? There is in this town, with a very few\\r\\nexceptions, no taste for the best or for very good books even in English\\r\\nliterature, whose words all can read and spell. Even the college-bred and so\\r\\ncalled liberally educated men here and elsewhere have really little or no\\r\\nacquaintance with the English classics; and as for the recorded wisdom of\\r\\nmankind, the ancient classics and Bibles, which are accessible to all who will\\r\\nknow of them, there are the feeblest efforts any where made to become\\r\\nacquainted with them. I know a woodchopper, of middle age, who takes a French\\r\\npaper, not for news as he says, for he is above that, but to “keep\\r\\nhimself in practice,” he being a Canadian by birth; and when I ask him\\r\\nwhat he considers the best thing he can do in this world, he says, beside this,\\r\\nto keep up and add to his English. This is about as much as the college bred\\r\\ngenerally do or aspire to do, and they take an English paper for the purpose.\\r\\nOne who has just come from reading perhaps one of the best English books will\\r\\nfind how many with whom he can converse about it? Or suppose he comes from\\r\\nreading a Greek or Latin classic in the original, whose praises are familiar\\r\\neven to the so called illiterate; he will find nobody at all to speak to, but\\r\\nmust keep silence about it. Indeed, there is hardly the professor in our\\r\\ncolleges, who, if he has mastered the difficulties of the language, has\\r\\nproportionally mastered the difficulties of the wit and poetry of a Greek poet,\\r\\nand has any sympathy to impart to the alert and heroic reader; and as for the\\r\\nsacred Scriptures, or Bibles of mankind, who in this town can tell me even\\r\\ntheir titles? Most men do not know that any nation but the Hebrews have had a\\r\\nscripture. A man, any man, will go considerably out of his way to pick up a\\r\\nsilver dollar; but here are golden words, which the wisest men of antiquity\\r\\nhave uttered, and whose worth the wise of every succeeding age have assured us\\r\\nof;—and yet we learn to read only as far as Easy Reading, the primers and\\r\\nclass-books, and when we leave school, the “Little Reading,” and\\r\\nstory books, which are for boys and beginners; and our reading, our\\r\\nconversation and thinking, are all on a very low level, worthy only of pygmies\\r\\nand manikins.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI aspire to be acquainted with wiser men than this our Concord soil has\\r\\nproduced, whose names are hardly known here. Or shall I hear the name of Plato\\r\\nand never read his book? As if Plato were my townsman and I never saw\\r\\nhim,—my next neighbor and I never heard him speak or attended to the\\r\\nwisdom of his words. But how actually is it? His Dialogues, which contain what\\r\\nwas immortal in him, lie on the next shelf, and yet I never read them. We are\\r\\nunderbred and low-lived and illiterate; and in this respect I confess I do not\\r\\nmake any very broad distinction between the illiterateness of my townsman who\\r\\ncannot read at all, and the illiterateness of him who has learned to read only\\r\\nwhat is for children and feeble intellects. We should be as good as the\\r\\nworthies of antiquity, but partly by first knowing how good they were. We are a\\r\\nrace of tit-men, and soar but little higher in our intellectual flights than\\r\\nthe columns of the daily paper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is not all books that are as dull as their readers. There are probably words\\r\\naddressed to our condition exactly, which, if we could really hear and\\r\\nunderstand, would be more salutary than the morning or the spring to our lives,\\r\\nand possibly put a new aspect on the face of things for us. How many a man has\\r\\ndated a new era in his life from the reading of a book. The book exists for us\\r\\nperchance which will explain our miracles and reveal new ones. The at present\\r\\nunutterable things we may find somewhere uttered. These same questions that\\r\\ndisturb and puzzle and confound us have in their turn occurred to all the wise\\r\\nmen; not one has been omitted; and each has answered them, according to his\\r\\nability, by his words and his life. Moreover, with wisdom we shall learn\\r\\nliberality. The solitary hired man on a farm in the outskirts of Concord, who\\r\\nhas had his second birth and peculiar religious experience, and is driven as he\\r\\nbelieves into the silent gravity and exclusiveness by his faith, may think it\\r\\nis not true; but Zoroaster, thousands of years ago, travelled the same road and\\r\\nhad the same experience; but he, being wise, knew it to be universal, and\\r\\ntreated his neighbors accordingly, and is even said to have invented and\\r\\nestablished worship among men. Let him humbly commune with Zoroaster then, and\\r\\nthrough the liberalizing influence of all the worthies, with Jesus Christ\\r\\nhimself, and let “our church” go by the board.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe boast that we belong to the nineteenth century and are making the most rapid\\r\\nstrides of any nation. But consider how little this village does for its own\\r\\nculture. I do not wish to flatter my townsmen, nor to be flattered by them, for\\r\\nthat will not advance either of us. We need to be provoked,—goaded like\\r\\noxen, as we are, into a trot. We have a comparatively decent system of common\\r\\nschools, schools for infants only; but excepting the half-starved Lyceum in the\\r\\nwinter, and latterly the puny beginning of a library suggested by the state, no\\r\\nschool for ourselves. We spend more on almost any article of bodily aliment or\\r\\nailment than on our mental aliment. It is time that we had uncommon schools,\\r\\nthat we did not leave off our education when we begin to be men and women. It\\r\\nis time that villages were universities, and their elder inhabitants the\\r\\nfellows of universities, with leisure—if they are indeed so well\\r\\noff—to pursue liberal studies the rest of their lives. Shall the world be\\r\\nconfined to one Paris or one Oxford forever? Cannot students be boarded here\\r\\nand get a liberal education under the skies of Concord? Can we not hire some\\r\\nAbelard to lecture to us? Alas! what with foddering the cattle and tending the\\r\\nstore, we are kept from school too long, and our education is sadly neglected.\\r\\nIn this country, the village should in some respects take the place of the\\r\\nnobleman of Europe. It should be the patron of the fine arts. It is rich\\r\\nenough. It wants only the magnanimity and refinement. It can spend money enough\\r\\non such things as farmers and traders value, but it is thought Utopian to\\r\\npropose spending money for things which more intelligent men know to be of far\\r\\nmore worth. This town has spent seventeen thousand dollars on a town-house,\\r\\nthank fortune or politics, but probably it will not spend so much on living\\r\\nwit, the true meat to put into that shell, in a hundred years. The one hundred\\r\\nand twenty-five dollars annually subscribed for a Lyceum in the winter is\\r\\nbetter spent than any other equal sum raised in the town. If we live in the\\r\\nnineteenth century, why should we not enjoy the advantages which the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury offers? Why should our life be in any respect provincial? If we will\\r\\nread newspapers, why not skip the gossip of Boston and take the best newspaper\\r\\nin the world at once?—not be sucking the pap of “neutral\\r\\nfamily” papers, or browsing “Olive-Branches” here in New\\r\\nEngland. Let the reports of all the learned societies come to us, and we will\\r\\nsee if they know any thing. Why should we leave it to Harper & Brothers and\\r\\nRedding & Co. to select our reading? As the nobleman of cultivated taste\\r\\nsurrounds himself with whatever conduces to his\\r\\nculture,—genius—learning—wit—books—paintings—statuary—music—philosophical\\r\\ninstruments, and the like; so let the village do,—not stop short at a\\r\\npedagogue, a parson, a sexton, a parish library, and three selectmen, because\\r\\nour pilgrim forefathers got through a cold winter once on a bleak rock with\\r\\nthese. To act collectively is according to the spirit of our institutions; and\\r\\nI am confident that, as our circumstances are more flourishing, our means are\\r\\ngreater than the nobleman’s. New England can hire all the wise men in the\\r\\nworld to come and teach her, and board them round the while, and not be\\r\\nprovincial at all. That is the uncommon school we want. Instead of\\r\\nnoblemen, let us have noble villages of men. If it is necessary, omit one\\r\\nbridge over the river, go round a little there, and throw one arch at least\\r\\nover the darker gulf of ignorance which surrounds us.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Sounds\\n\\r\\nBut while we are confined to books, though the most select and classic, and\\r\\nread only particular written languages, which are themselves but dialects and\\r\\nprovincial, we are in danger of forgetting the language which all things and\\r\\nevents speak without metaphor, which alone is copious and standard. Much is\\r\\npublished, but little printed. The rays which stream through the shutter will\\r\\nbe no longer remembered when the shutter is wholly removed. No method nor\\r\\ndiscipline can supersede the necessity of being forever on the alert. What is a\\r\\ncourse of history, or philosophy, or poetry, no matter how well selected, or the\\r\\nbest society, or the most admirable routine of life, compared with the\\r\\ndiscipline of looking always at what is to be seen? Will you be a reader, a\\r\\nstudent merely, or a seer? Read your fate, see what is before you, and walk on\\r\\ninto futurity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI did not read books the first summer; I hoed beans. Nay, I often did better\\r\\nthan this. There were times when I could not afford to sacrifice the bloom of\\r\\nthe present moment to any work, whether of the head or hands. I love a broad\\r\\nmargin to my life. Sometimes, in a summer morning, having taken my accustomed\\r\\nbath, I sat in my sunny doorway from sunrise till noon, rapt in a revery,\\r\\namidst the pines and hickories and sumachs, in undisturbed solitude and\\r\\nstillness, while the birds sing around or flitted noiseless through the house,\\r\\nuntil by the sun falling in at my west window, or the noise of some\\r\\ntraveller’s wagon on the distant highway, I was reminded of the lapse of\\r\\ntime. I grew in those seasons like corn in the night, and they were far better\\r\\nthan any work of the hands would have been. They were not time subtracted from\\r\\nmy life, but so much over and above my usual allowance. I realized what the\\r\\nOrientals mean by contemplation and the forsaking of works. For the most part,\\r\\nI minded not how the hours went. The day advanced as if to light some work of\\r\\nmine; it was morning, and lo, now it is evening, and nothing memorable is\\r\\naccomplished. Instead of singing like the birds, I silently smiled at my\\r\\nincessant good fortune. As the sparrow had its trill, sitting on the hickory\\r\\nbefore my door, so had I my chuckle or suppressed warble which he might hear\\r\\nout of my nest. My days were not days of the week, bearing the stamp of any\\r\\nheathen deity, nor were they minced into hours and fretted by the ticking of a\\r\\nclock; for I lived like the Puri Indians, of whom it is said that “for\\r\\nyesterday, to-day, and to-morrow they have only one word, and they express the\\r\\nvariety of meaning by pointing backward for yesterday, forward for to-morrow,\\r\\nand overhead for the passing day.” This was sheer idleness to my\\r\\nfellow-townsmen, no doubt; but if the birds and flowers had tried me by their\\r\\nstandard, I should not have been found wanting. A man must find his occasions\\r\\nin himself, it is true. The natural day is very calm, and will hardly reprove\\r\\nhis indolence.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had this advantage, at least, in my mode of life, over those who were obliged\\r\\nto look abroad for amusement, to society and the theatre, that my life itself\\r\\nwas become my amusement and never ceased to be novel. It was a drama of many\\r\\nscenes and without an end. If we were always indeed getting our living, and\\r\\nregulating our lives according to the last and best mode we had learned, we\\r\\nshould never be troubled with ennui. Follow your genius closely enough, and it\\r\\nwill not fail to show you a fresh prospect every hour. Housework was a pleasant\\r\\npastime. When my floor was dirty, I rose early, and, setting all my furniture\\r\\nout of doors on the grass, bed and bedstead making but one budget, dashed water\\r\\non the floor, and sprinkled white sand from the pond on it, and then with a\\r\\nbroom scrubbed it clean and white; and by the time the villagers had broken\\r\\ntheir fast the morning sun had dried my house sufficiently to allow me to move\\r\\nin again, and my meditations were almost uninterupted. It was pleasant to see\\r\\nmy whole household effects out on the grass, making a little pile like a\\r\\ngypsy’s pack, and my three-legged table, from which I did not remove the\\r\\nbooks and pen and ink, standing amid the pines and hickories. They seemed glad\\r\\nto get out themselves, and as if unwilling to be brought in. I was sometimes\\r\\ntempted to stretch an awning over them and take my seat there. It was worth the\\r\\nwhile to see the sun shine on these things, and hear the free wind blow on\\r\\nthem; so much more interesting most familiar objects look out of doors than in\\r\\nthe house. A bird sits on the next bough, life-everlasting grows under the\\r\\ntable, and blackberry vines run round its legs; pine cones, chestnut burs, and\\r\\nstrawberry leaves are strewn about. It looked as if this was the way these\\r\\nforms came to be transferred to our furniture, to tables, chairs, and\\r\\nbedsteads,—because they once stood in their midst.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy house was on the side of a hill, immediately on the edge of the larger wood,\\r\\nin the midst of a young forest of pitch pines and hickories, and half a dozen\\r\\nrods from the pond, to which a narrow footpath led down the hill. In my front\\r\\nyard grew the strawberry, blackberry, and life-everlasting, johnswort and\\r\\ngoldenrod, shrub-oaks and sand-cherry, blueberry and groundnut. Near the end of\\r\\nMay, the sand-cherry (Cerasus pumila,) adorned the sides of the path with\\r\\nits delicate flowers arranged in umbels cylindrically about its short stems,\\r\\nwhich last, in the fall, weighed down with good sized and handsome cherries,\\r\\nfell over in wreaths like rays on every side. I tasted them out of compliment\\r\\nto Nature, though they were scarcely palatable. The sumach (Rhus glabra,)\\r\\ngrew luxuriantly about the house, pushing up through the embankment which I had\\r\\nmade, and growing five or six feet the first season. Its broad pinnate tropical\\r\\nleaf was pleasant though strange to look on. The large buds, suddenly pushing\\r\\nout late in the spring from dry sticks which had seemed to be dead, developed\\r\\nthemselves as by magic into graceful green and tender boughs, an inch in\\r\\ndiameter; and sometimes, as I sat at my window, so heedlessly did they grow and\\r\\ntax their weak joints, I heard a fresh and tender bough suddenly fall like a\\r\\nfan to the ground, when there was not a breath of air stirring, broken off by\\r\\nits own weight. In August, the large masses of berries, which, when in flower,\\r\\nhad attracted many wild bees, gradually assumed their bright velvety crimson\\r\\nhue, and by their weight again bent down and broke the tender limbs.\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I sit at my window this summer afternoon, hawks are circling about my\\r\\nclearing; the tantivy of wild pigeons, flying by twos and threes athwart my\\r\\nview, or perching restless on the white-pine boughs behind my house, gives a\\r\\nvoice to the air; a fishhawk dimples the glassy surface of the pond and brings\\r\\nup a fish; a mink steals out of the marsh before my door and seizes a frog by\\r\\nthe shore; the sedge is bending under the weight of the reed-birds flitting\\r\\nhither and thither; and for the last half hour I have heard the rattle of\\r\\nrailroad cars, now dying away and then reviving like the beat of a partridge,\\r\\nconveying travellers from Boston to the country. For I did not live so out of\\r\\nthe world as that boy who, as I hear, was put out to a farmer in the east part\\r\\nof the town, but ere long ran away and came home again, quite down at the heel\\r\\nand homesick. He had never seen such a dull and out-of-the-way place; the folks\\r\\nwere all gone off; why, you couldn’t even hear the whistle! I doubt if\\r\\nthere is such a place in Massachusetts now:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In truth, our village has become a butt\\r\\nFor one of those fleet railroad shafts, and o’er\\r\\nOur peaceful plain its soothing sound is—Concord.”\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Fitchburg Railroad touches the pond about a hundred rods south of where I\\r\\ndwell. I usually go to the village along its causeway, and am, as it were,\\r\\nrelated to society by this link. The men on the freight trains, who go over the\\r\\nwhole length of the road, bow to me as to an old acquaintance, they pass me so\\r\\noften, and apparently they take me for an employee; and so I am. I too would\\r\\nfain be a track-repairer somewhere in the orbit of the earth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe whistle of the locomotive penetrates my woods summer and winter, sounding\\r\\nlike the scream of a hawk sailing over some farmer’s yard, informing me\\r\\nthat many restless city merchants are arriving within the circle of the town,\\r\\nor adventurous country traders from the other side. As they come under one\\r\\nhorizon, they shout their warning to get off the track to the other, heard\\r\\nsometimes through the circles of two towns. Here come your groceries, country;\\r\\nyour rations, countrymen! Nor is there any man so independent on his farm that\\r\\nhe can say them nay. And here’s your pay for them! screams the\\r\\ncountryman’s whistle; timber like long battering rams going twenty miles\\r\\nan hour against the city’s walls, and chairs enough to seat all the weary\\r\\nand heavy laden that dwell within them. With such huge and lumbering civility\\r\\nthe country hands a chair to the city. All the Indian huckleberry hills are\\r\\nstripped, all the cranberry meadows are raked into the city. Up comes the\\r\\ncotton, down goes the woven cloth; up comes the silk, down goes the woollen; up\\r\\ncome the books, but down goes the wit that writes them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I meet the engine with its train of cars moving off with planetary\\r\\nmotion,—or, rather, like a comet, for the beholder knows not if with that\\r\\nvelocity and with that direction it will ever revisit this system, since its\\r\\norbit does not look like a returning curve,—with its steam cloud like a\\r\\nbanner streaming behind in golden and silver wreaths, like many a downy cloud\\r\\nwhich I have seen, high in the heavens, unfolding its masses to the\\r\\nlight,—as if this travelling demigod, this cloud-compeller, would ere long\\r\\ntake the sunset sky for the livery of his train; when I hear the iron horse\\r\\nmake the hills echo with his snort like thunder, shaking the earth with his\\r\\nfeet, and breathing fire and smoke from his nostrils, (what kind of winged horse\\r\\nor fiery dragon they will put into the new Mythology I don’t know), it\\r\\nseems as if the earth had got a race now worthy to inhabit it. If all were as\\r\\nit seems, and men made the elements their servants for noble ends! If the cloud\\r\\nthat hangs over the engine were the perspiration of heroic deeds, or as\\r\\nbeneficent as that which floats over the farmer’s fields, then the\\r\\nelements and Nature herself would cheerfully accompany men on their errands and\\r\\nbe their escort.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI watch the passage of the morning cars with the same feeling that I do the\\r\\nrising of the sun, which is hardly more regular. Their train of clouds\\r\\nstretching far behind and rising higher and higher, going to heaven while the\\r\\ncars are going to Boston, conceals the sun for a minute and casts my distant\\r\\nfield into the shade, a celestial train beside which the petty train of cars\\r\\nwhich hugs the earth is but the barb of the spear. The stabler of the iron\\r\\nhorse was up early this winter morning by the light of the stars amid the\\r\\nmountains, to fodder and harness his steed. Fire, too, was awakened thus early\\r\\nto put the vital heat in him and get him off. If the enterprise were as\\r\\ninnocent as it is early! If the snow lies deep, they strap on his snow-shoes,\\r\\nand with the giant plow, plow a furrow from the mountains to the seaboard, in\\r\\nwhich the cars, like a following drill-barrow, sprinkle all the restless men\\r\\nand floating merchandise in the country for seed. All day the fire-steed flies\\r\\nover the country, stopping only that his master may rest, and I am awakened by\\r\\nhis tramp and defiant snort at midnight, when in some remote glen in the woods\\r\\nhe fronts the elements incased in ice and snow; and he will reach his stall\\r\\nonly with the morning star, to start once more on his travels without rest or\\r\\nslumber. Or perchance, at evening, I hear him in his stable blowing off the\\r\\nsuperfluous energy of the day, that he may calm his nerves and cool his liver\\r\\nand brain for a few hours of iron slumber. If the enterprise were as heroic and\\r\\ncommanding as it is protracted and unwearied!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFar through unfrequented woods on the confines of towns, where once only the\\r\\nhunter penetrated by day, in the darkest night dart these bright saloons\\r\\nwithout the knowledge of their inhabitants; this moment stopping at some\\r\\nbrilliant station-house in town or city, where a social crowd is gathered, the\\r\\nnext in the Dismal Swamp, scaring the owl and fox. The startings and arrivals\\r\\nof the cars are now the epochs in the village day. They go and come with such\\r\\nregularity and precision, and their whistle can be heard so far, that the\\r\\nfarmers set their clocks by them, and thus one well conducted institution\\r\\nregulates a whole country. Have not men improved somewhat in punctuality since\\r\\nthe railroad was invented? Do they not talk and think faster in the depot than\\r\\nthey did in the stage-office? There is something electrifying in the atmosphere\\r\\nof the former place. I have been astonished at the miracles it has wrought;\\r\\nthat some of my neighbors, who, I should have prophesied, once for all, would\\r\\nnever get to Boston by so prompt a conveyance, are on hand when the bell rings.\\r\\nTo do things “railroad fashion” is now the by-word; and it is worth\\r\\nthe while to be warned so often and so sincerely by any power to get off its\\r\\ntrack. There is no stopping to read the riot act, no firing over the heads of\\r\\nthe mob, in this case. We have constructed a fate, an Atropos, that\\r\\nnever turns aside. (Let that be the name of your engine.) Men are advertised\\r\\nthat at a certain hour and minute these bolts will be shot toward particular\\r\\npoints of the compass; yet it interferes with no man’s business, and the\\r\\nchildren go to school on the other track. We live the steadier for it. We are\\r\\nall educated thus to be sons of Tell. The air is full of invisible bolts. Every\\r\\npath but your own is the path of fate. Keep on your own track, then.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhat recommends commerce to me is its enterprise and bravery. It does not clasp\\r\\nits hands and pray to Jupiter. I see these men every day go about their\\r\\nbusiness with more or less courage and content, doing more even than they\\r\\nsuspect, and perchance better employed than they could have consciously\\r\\ndevised. I am less affected by their heroism who stood up for half an hour in\\r\\nthe front line at Buena Vista, than by the steady and cheerful valor of the men\\r\\nwho inhabit the snow-plough for their winter quarters; who have not merely the\\r\\nthree-o’-clock in the morning courage, which Bonaparte thought was the\\r\\nrarest, but whose courage does not go to rest so early, who go to sleep only\\r\\nwhen the storm sleeps or the sinews of their iron steed are frozen. On this\\r\\nmorning of the Great Snow, perchance, which is still raging and chilling\\r\\nmen’s blood, I hear the muffled tone of their engine bell from out the\\r\\nfog bank of their chilled breath, which announces that the cars are\\r\\ncoming, without long delay, notwithstanding the veto of a New England\\r\\nnorth-east snow storm, and I behold the ploughmen covered with snow and rime,\\r\\ntheir heads peering, above the mould-board which is turning down other than\\r\\ndaisies and the nests of field-mice, like bowlders of the Sierra Nevada, that\\r\\noccupy an outside place in the universe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCommerce is unexpectedly confident and serene, alert, adventurous, and\\r\\nunwearied. It is very natural in its methods withal, far more so than many\\r\\nfantastic enterprises and sentimental experiments, and hence its singular\\r\\nsuccess. I am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me,\\r\\nand I smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from Long\\r\\nWharf to Lake Champlain, reminding me of foreign parts, of coral reefs, and\\r\\nIndian oceans, and tropical climes, and the extent of the globe. I feel more\\r\\nlike a citizen of the world at the sight of the palm-leaf which will cover so\\r\\nmany flaxen New England heads the next summer, the Manilla hemp and cocoa-nut\\r\\nhusks, the old junk, gunny bags, scrap iron, and rusty nails. This car-load of\\r\\ntorn sails is more legible and interesting now than if they should be wrought\\r\\ninto paper and printed books. Who can write so graphically the history of the\\r\\nstorms they have weathered as these rents have done? They are proof-sheets\\r\\nwhich need no correction. Here goes lumber from the Maine woods, which did not\\r\\ngo out to sea in the last freshet, risen four dollars on the thousand because\\r\\nof what did go out or was split up; pine, spruce, cedar,—first, second,\\r\\nthird, and fourth qualities, so lately all of one quality, to wave over the\\r\\nbear, and moose, and caribou. Next rolls Thomaston lime, a prime lot, which\\r\\nwill get far among the hills before it gets slacked. These rags in bales, of\\r\\nall hues and qualities, the lowest condition to which cotton and linen descend,\\r\\nthe final result of dress,—of patterns which are now no longer cried up,\\r\\nunless it be in Milwaukie, as those splendid articles, English, French, or\\r\\nAmerican prints, ginghams, muslins, &c., gathered from all quarters both of\\r\\nfashion and poverty, going to become paper of one color or a few shades only,\\r\\non which forsooth will be written tales of real life, high and low, and\\r\\nfounded on fact! This closed car smells of salt fish, the strong New England\\r\\nand commercial scent, reminding me of the Grand Banks and the fisheries. Who\\r\\nhas not seen a salt fish, thoroughly cured for this world, so that nothing can\\r\\nspoil it, and putting the perseverance of the saints to the blush? with which\\r\\nyou may sweep or pave the streets, and split your kindlings, and the teamster\\r\\nshelter himself and his lading against sun wind and rain behind it,—and\\r\\nthe trader, as a Concord trader once did, hang it up by his door for a sign\\r\\nwhen he commences business, until at last his oldest customer cannot tell\\r\\nsurely whether it be animal, vegetable, or mineral, and yet it shall be as pure\\r\\nas a snowflake, and if it be put into a pot and boiled, will come out an\\r\\nexcellent dun fish for a Saturday’s dinner. Next Spanish hides, with the\\r\\ntails still preserving their twist and the angle of elevation they had when the\\r\\noxen that wore them were careering over the pampas of the Spanish main,—a\\r\\ntype of all obstinacy, and evincing how almost hopeless and incurable are all\\r\\nconstitutional vices. I confess, that practically speaking, when I have learned\\r\\na man’s real disposition, I have no hopes of changing it for the better\\r\\nor worse in this state of existence. As the Orientals say, “A cur’s\\r\\ntail may be warmed, and pressed, and bound round with ligatures, and after a\\r\\ntwelve years’ labor bestowed upon it, still it will retain its natural\\r\\nform.” The only effectual cure for such inveteracies as these tails\\r\\nexhibit is to make glue of them, which I believe is what is usually done with\\r\\nthem, and then they will stay put and stick. Here is a hogshead of molasses or\\r\\nof brandy directed to John Smith, Cuttingsville, Vermont, some trader among the\\r\\nGreen Mountains, who imports for the farmers near his clearing, and now\\r\\nperchance stands over his bulk-head and thinks of the last arrivals on the\\r\\ncoast, how they may affect the price for him, telling his customers this\\r\\nmoment, as he has told them twenty times before this morning, that he expects\\r\\nsome by the next train of prime quality. It is advertised in the Cuttingsville\\r\\nTimes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile these things go up other things come down. Warned by the whizzing sound,\\r\\nI look up from my book and see some tall pine, hewn on far northern hills,\\r\\nwhich has winged its way over the Green Mountains and the Connecticut, shot\\r\\nlike an arrow through the township within ten minutes, and scarce another eye\\r\\nbeholds it; going\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“to be the mast\\r\\nOf some great ammiral.”\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd hark! here comes the cattle-train bearing the cattle of a thousand hills,\\r\\nsheepcots, stables, and cow-yards in the air, drovers with their sticks, and\\r\\nshepherd boys in the midst of their flocks, all but the mountain pastures,\\r\\nwhirled along like leaves blown from the mountains by the September gales. The\\r\\nair is filled with the bleating of calves and sheep, and the hustling of oxen,\\r\\nas if a pastoral valley were going by. When the old bell-wether at the head\\r\\nrattles his bell, the mountains do indeed skip like rams and the little hills\\r\\nlike lambs. A car-load of drovers, too, in the midst, on a level with their\\r\\ndroves now, their vocation gone, but still clinging to their useless sticks as\\r\\ntheir badge of office. But their dogs, where are they? It is a stampede to\\r\\nthem; they are quite thrown out; they have lost the scent. Methinks I hear them\\r\\nbarking behind the Peterboro’ Hills, or panting up the western slope of\\r\\nthe Green Mountains. They will not be in at the death. Their vocation, too, is\\r\\ngone. Their fidelity and sagacity are below par now. They will slink back to\\r\\ntheir kennels in disgrace, or perchance run wild and strike a league with the\\r\\nwolf and the fox. So is your pastoral life whirled past and away. But the bell\\r\\nrings, and I must get off the track and let the cars go by;—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhat’s the railroad to me?\\r\\nI never go to see\\r\\nWhere it ends.\\r\\nIt fills a few hollows,\\r\\nAnd makes banks for the swallows,\\r\\nIt sets the sand a-blowing,\\r\\nAnd the blackberries a-growing,\\n\\n\\r\\nbut I cross it like a cart-path in the woods. I will not have my eyes put out\\r\\nand my ears spoiled by its smoke and steam and hissing.\\n\\n\\r\\nNow that the cars are gone by and all the restless world with them, and the\\r\\nfishes in the pond no longer feel their rumbling, I am more alone than ever.\\r\\nFor the rest of the long afternoon, perhaps, my meditations are interrupted\\r\\nonly by the faint rattle of a carriage or team along the distant highway.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSometimes, on Sundays, I heard the bells, the Lincoln, Acton, Bedford, or\\r\\nConcord bell, when the wind was favorable, a faint, sweet, and, as it were,\\r\\nnatural melody, worth importing into the wilderness. At a sufficient distance\\r\\nover the woods this sound acquires a certain vibratory hum, as if the pine\\r\\nneedles in the horizon were the strings of a harp which it swept. All sound\\r\\nheard at the greatest possible distance produces one and the same effect, a\\r\\nvibration of the universal lyre, just as the intervening atmosphere makes a\\r\\ndistant ridge of earth interesting to our eyes by the azure tint it imparts to\\r\\nit. There came to me in this case a melody which the air had strained, and\\r\\nwhich had conversed with every leaf and needle of the wood, that portion of the\\r\\nsound which the elements had taken up and modulated and echoed from vale to\\r\\nvale. The echo is, to some extent, an original sound, and therein is the magic\\r\\nand charm of it. It is not merely a repetition of what was worth repeating in\\r\\nthe bell, but partly the voice of the wood; the same trivial words and notes\\r\\nsung by a wood-nymph.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt evening, the distant lowing of some cow in the horizon beyond the woods\\r\\nsounded sweet and melodious, and at first I would mistake it for the voices of\\r\\ncertain minstrels by whom I was sometimes serenaded, who might be straying over\\r\\nhill and dale; but soon I was not unpleasantly disappointed when it was\\r\\nprolonged into the cheap and natural music of the cow. I do not mean to be\\r\\nsatirical, but to express my appreciation of those youths’ singing, when\\r\\nI state that I perceived clearly that it was akin to the music of the cow, and\\r\\nthey were at length one articulation of Nature.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nRegularly at half past seven, in one part of the summer, after the evening\\r\\ntrain had gone by, the whippoorwills chanted their vespers for half an hour,\\r\\nsitting on a stump by my door, or upon the ridge pole of the house. They would\\r\\nbegin to sing almost with as much precision as a clock, within five minutes of\\r\\na particular time, referred to the setting of the sun, every evening. I had a\\r\\nrare opportunity to become acquainted with their habits. Sometimes I heard four\\r\\nor five at once in different parts of the wood, by accident one a bar behind\\r\\nanother, and so near me that I distinguished not only the cluck after each\\r\\nnote, but often that singular buzzing sound like a fly in a spider’s web,\\r\\nonly proportionally louder. Sometimes one would circle round and round me in\\r\\nthe woods a few feet distant as if tethered by a string, when probably I was\\r\\nnear its eggs. They sang at intervals throughout the night, and were again as\\r\\nmusical as ever just before and about dawn.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen other birds are still the screech owls take up the strain, like mourning\\r\\nwomen their ancient u-lu-lu. Their dismal scream is truly Ben Jonsonian. Wise\\r\\nmidnight hags! It is no honest and blunt tu-whit tu-who of the poets, but,\\r\\nwithout jesting, a most solemn graveyard ditty, the mutual consolations of\\r\\nsuicide lovers remembering the pangs and the delights of supernal love in the\\r\\ninfernal groves. Yet I love to hear their wailing, their doleful responses,\\r\\ntrilled along the wood-side; reminding me sometimes of music and singing birds;\\r\\nas if it were the dark and tearful side of music, the regrets and sighs that\\r\\nwould fain be sung. They are the spirits, the low spirits and melancholy\\r\\nforebodings, of fallen souls that once in human shape night-walked the earth\\r\\nand did the deeds of darkness, now expiating their sins with their wailing\\r\\nhymns or threnodies in the scenery of their transgressions. They give me a new\\r\\nsense of the variety and capacity of that nature which is our common dwelling.\\r\\nOh-o-o-o-o that I never had been bor-r-r-r-n! sighs one on this side of\\r\\nthe pond, and circles with the restlessness of despair to some new perch on the\\r\\ngray oaks. Then—that I never had been bor-r-r-r-n! echoes another\\r\\non the farther side with tremulous sincerity, and—bor-r-r-r-n!\\r\\ncomes faintly from far in the Lincoln woods.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI was also serenaded by a hooting owl. Near at hand you could fancy it the most\\r\\nmelancholy sound in Nature, as if she meant by this to stereotype and make\\r\\npermanent in her choir the dying moans of a human being,—some poor weak\\r\\nrelic of mortality who has left hope behind, and howls like an animal, yet with\\r\\nhuman sobs, on entering the dark valley, made more awful by a certain gurgling\\r\\nmelodiousness,—I find myself beginning with the letters gl when I try to\\r\\nimitate it,—expressive of a mind which has reached the gelatinous mildewy\\r\\nstage in the mortification of all healthy and courageous thought. It reminded\\r\\nme of ghouls and idiots and insane howlings. But now one answers from far woods\\r\\nin a strain made really melodious by distance,—Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer\\r\\nhoo; and indeed for the most part it suggested only pleasing associations,\\r\\nwhether heard by day or night, summer or winter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI rejoice that there are owls. Let them do the idiotic and maniacal hooting for\\r\\nmen. It is a sound admirably suited to swamps and twilight woods which no day\\r\\nillustrates, suggesting a vast and undeveloped nature which men have not\\r\\nrecognized. They represent the stark twilight and unsatisfied thoughts which\\r\\nall have. All day the sun has shone on the surface of some savage swamp, where\\r\\nthe single spruce stands hung with usnea lichens, and small hawks circulate\\r\\nabove, and the chickadee lisps amid the evergreens, and the partridge and\\r\\nrabbit skulk beneath; but now a more dismal and fitting day dawns, and a\\r\\ndifferent race of creatures awakes to express the meaning of Nature there.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLate in the evening I heard the distant rumbling of wagons over\\r\\nbridges,—a sound heard farther than almost any other at night,—the\\r\\nbaying of dogs, and sometimes again the lowing of some disconsolate cow in a\\r\\ndistant barn-yard. In the mean while all the shore rang with the trump of\\r\\nbullfrogs, the sturdy spirits of ancient wine-bibbers and wassailers, still\\r\\nunrepentant, trying to sing a catch in their Stygian lake,—if the Walden\\r\\nnymphs will pardon the comparison, for though there are almost no weeds, there\\r\\nare frogs there,—who would fain keep up the hilarious rules of their old\\r\\nfestal tables, though their voices have waxed hoarse and solemnly grave,\\r\\nmocking at mirth, and the wine has lost its flavor, and become only liquor to\\r\\ndistend their paunches, and sweet intoxication never comes to drown the memory\\r\\nof the past, but mere saturation and waterloggedness and distention. The most\\r\\naldermanic, with his chin upon a heart-leaf, which serves for a napkin to his\\r\\ndrooling chaps, under this northern shore quaffs a deep draught of the once\\r\\nscorned water, and passes round the cup with the ejaculation tr-r-r-oonk,\\r\\ntr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r-oonk! and straightway comes over the water from some\\r\\ndistant cove the same password repeated, where the next in seniority and girth\\r\\nhas gulped down to his mark; and when this observance has made the circuit of\\r\\nthe shores, then ejaculates the master of ceremonies, with satisfaction,\\r\\ntr-r-r-oonk! and each in his turn repeats the same down to the least\\r\\ndistended, leakiest, and flabbiest paunched, that there be no mistake; and then\\r\\nthe bowl goes round again and again, until the sun disperses the morning mist,\\r\\nand only the patriarch is not under the pond, but vainly bellowing\\r\\ntroonk from time to time, and pausing for a reply.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI am not sure that I ever heard the sound of cock-crowing from my clearing, and\\r\\nI thought that it might be worth the while to keep a cockerel for his music\\r\\nmerely, as a singing bird. The note of this once wild Indian pheasant is\\r\\ncertainly the most remarkable of any bird’s, and if they could be\\r\\nnaturalized without being domesticated, it would soon become the most famous\\r\\nsound in our woods, surpassing the clangor of the goose and the hooting of the\\r\\nowl; and then imagine the cackling of the hens to fill the pauses when their\\r\\nlords’ clarions rested! No wonder that man added this bird to his tame\\r\\nstock,—to say nothing of the eggs and drumsticks. To walk in a winter\\r\\nmorning in a wood where these birds abounded, their native woods, and hear the\\r\\nwild cockerels crow on the trees, clear and shrill for miles over the\\r\\nresounding earth, drowning the feebler notes of other birds,—think of it!\\r\\nIt would put nations on the alert. Who would not be early to rise, and rise\\r\\nearlier and earlier every successive day of his life, till he became\\r\\nunspeakably healthy, wealthy, and wise? This foreign bird’s note is\\r\\ncelebrated by the poets of all countries along with the notes of their native\\r\\nsongsters. All climates agree with brave Chanticleer. He is more indigenous\\r\\neven than the natives. His health is ever good, his lungs are sound, his\\r\\nspirits never flag. Even the sailor on the Atlantic and Pacific is awakened by\\r\\nhis voice; but its shrill sound never roused me from my slumbers. I kept\\r\\nneither dog, cat, cow, pig, nor hens, so that you would have said there was a\\r\\ndeficiency of domestic sounds; neither the churn, nor the spinning wheel, nor\\r\\neven the singing of the kettle, nor the hissing of the urn, nor children\\r\\ncrying, to comfort one. An old-fashioned man would have lost his senses or died\\r\\nof ennui before this. Not even rats in the wall, for they were starved out, or\\r\\nrather were never baited in,—only squirrels on the roof and under the\\r\\nfloor, a whippoorwill on the ridge pole, a blue-jay screaming beneath the\\r\\nwindow, a hare or woodchuck under the house, a screech-owl or a cat-owl behind\\r\\nit, a flock of wild geese or a laughing loon on the pond, and a fox to bark in\\r\\nthe night. Not even a lark or an oriole, those mild plantation birds, ever\\r\\nvisited my clearing. No cockerels to crow nor hens to cackle in the yard. No\\r\\nyard! but unfenced Nature reaching up to your very sills. A young forest\\r\\ngrowing up under your meadows, and wild sumachs and blackberry vines breaking\\r\\nthrough into your cellar; sturdy pitch pines rubbing and creaking against the\\r\\nshingles for want of room, their roots reaching quite under the house. Instead\\r\\nof a scuttle or a blind blown off in the gale,—a pine tree snapped off or\\r\\ntorn up by the roots behind your house for fuel. Instead of no path to the\\r\\nfront-yard gate in the Great Snow,—no gate,—no\\r\\nfront-yard,—and no path to the civilized world!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Solitude\\n\\r\\nThis is a delicious evening, when the whole body is one sense, and imbibes\\r\\ndelight through every pore. I go and come with a strange liberty in Nature, a\\r\\npart of herself. As I walk along the stony shore of the pond in my\\r\\nshirt sleeves, though it is cool as well as cloudy and windy, and I see nothing\\r\\nspecial to attract me, all the elements are unusually congenial to me. The\\r\\nbullfrogs trump to usher in the night, and the note of the whippoorwill is\\r\\nborne on the rippling wind from over the water. Sympathy with the fluttering\\r\\nalder and poplar leaves almost takes away my breath; yet, like the lake, my\\r\\nserenity is rippled but not ruffled. These small waves raised by the evening\\r\\nwind are as remote from storm as the smooth reflecting surface. Though it is\\r\\nnow dark, the wind still blows and roars in the wood, the waves still dash, and\\r\\nsome creatures lull the rest with their notes. The repose is never complete.\\r\\nThe wildest animals do not repose, but seek their prey now; the fox, and skunk,\\r\\nand rabbit, now roam the fields and woods without fear. They are Nature’s\\r\\nwatchmen,—links which connect the days of animated life.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I return to my house I find that visitors have been there and left their\\r\\ncards, either a bunch of flowers, or a wreath of evergreen, or a name in pencil\\r\\non a yellow walnut leaf or a chip. They who come rarely to the woods take some\\r\\nlittle piece of the forest into their hands to play with by the way, which they\\r\\nleave, either intentionally or accidentally. One has peeled a willow wand,\\r\\nwoven it into a ring, and dropped it on my table. I could always tell if\\r\\nvisitors had called in my absence, either by the bended twigs or grass, or the\\r\\nprint of their shoes, and generally of what sex or age or quality they were by\\r\\nsome slight trace left, as a flower dropped, or a bunch of grass plucked and\\r\\nthrown away, even as far off as the railroad, half a mile distant, or by the\\r\\nlingering odor of a cigar or pipe. Nay, I was frequently notified of the\\r\\npassage of a traveller along the highway sixty rods off by the scent of his\\r\\npipe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere is commonly sufficient space about us. Our horizon is never quite at our\\r\\nelbows. The thick wood is not just at our door, nor the pond, but somewhat is\\r\\nalways clearing, familiar and worn by us, appropriated and fenced in some way,\\r\\nand reclaimed from Nature. For what reason have I this vast range and circuit,\\r\\nsome square miles of unfrequented forest, for my privacy, abandoned to me by\\r\\nmen? My nearest neighbor is a mile distant, and no house is visible from any\\r\\nplace but the hill-tops within half a mile of my own. I have my horizon bounded\\r\\nby woods all to myself; a distant view of the railroad where it touches the\\r\\npond on the one hand, and of the fence which skirts the woodland road on the\\r\\nother. But for the most part it is as solitary where I live as on the prairies.\\r\\nIt is as much Asia or Africa as New England. I have, as it were, my own sun and\\r\\nmoon and stars, and a little world all to myself. At night there was never a\\r\\ntraveller passed my house, or knocked at my door, more than if I were the first\\r\\nor last man; unless it were in the spring, when at long intervals some came\\r\\nfrom the village to fish for pouts,—they plainly fished much more in the\\r\\nWalden Pond of their own natures, and baited their hooks with\\r\\ndarkness,—but they soon retreated, usually with light baskets, and left\\r\\n“the world to darkness and to me,” and the black kernel of the\\r\\nnight was never profaned by any human neighborhood. I believe that men are\\r\\ngenerally still a little afraid of the dark, though the witches are all hung,\\r\\nand Christianity and candles have been introduced.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYet I experienced sometimes that the most sweet and tender, the most innocent\\r\\nand encouraging society may be found in any natural object, even for the poor\\r\\nmisanthrope and most melancholy man. There can be no very black melancholy to\\r\\nhim who lives in the midst of Nature and has his senses still. There was never\\r\\nyet such a storm but it was Ã\\x86olian music to a healthy and innocent ear. Nothing\\r\\ncan rightly compel a simple and brave man to a vulgar sadness. While I enjoy\\r\\nthe friendship of the seasons I trust that nothing can make life a burden to\\r\\nme. The gentle rain which waters my beans and keeps me in the house to-day is\\r\\nnot drear and melancholy, but good for me too. Though it prevents my hoeing\\r\\nthem, it is of far more worth than my hoeing. If it should continue so long as\\r\\nto cause the seeds to rot in the ground and destroy the potatoes in the low\\r\\nlands, it would still be good for the grass on the uplands, and, being good for\\r\\nthe grass, it would be good for me. Sometimes, when I compare myself with other\\r\\nmen, it seems as if I were more favored by the gods than they, beyond any\\r\\ndeserts that I am conscious of; as if I had a warrant and surety at their hands\\r\\nwhich my fellows have not, and were especially guided and guarded. I do not\\r\\nflatter myself, but if it be possible they flatter me. I have never felt\\r\\nlonesome, or in the least oppressed by a sense of solitude, but once, and that\\r\\nwas a few weeks after I came to the woods, when, for an hour, I doubted if the\\r\\nnear neighborhood of man was not essential to a serene and healthy life. To be\\r\\nalone was something unpleasant. But I was at the same time conscious of a\\r\\nslight insanity in my mood, and seemed to foresee my recovery. In the midst of\\r\\na gentle rain while these thoughts prevailed, I was suddenly sensible of such\\r\\nsweet and beneficent society in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and\\r\\nin every sound and sight around my house, an infinite and unaccountable\\r\\nfriendliness all at once like an atmosphere sustaining me, as made the fancied\\r\\nadvantages of human neighborhood insignificant, and I have never thought of\\r\\nthem since. Every little pine needle expanded and swelled with sympathy and\\r\\nbefriended me. I was so distinctly made aware of the presence of something\\r\\nkindred to me, even in scenes which we are accustomed to call wild and dreary,\\r\\nand also that the nearest of blood to me and humanest was not a person nor a\\r\\nvillager, that I thought no place could ever be strange to me again.—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mourning untimely consumes the sad;\\r\\nFew are their days in the land of the living,\\r\\nBeautiful daughter of Toscar.”\\n\\n\\r\\nSome of my pleasantest hours were during the long rain storms in the spring or\\r\\nfall, which confined me to the house for the afternoon as well as the forenoon,\\r\\nsoothed by their ceaseless roar and pelting; when an early twilight ushered in\\r\\na long evening in which many thoughts had time to take root and unfold\\r\\nthemselves. In those driving north-east rains which tried the village houses so,\\r\\nwhen the maids stood ready with mop and pail in front entries to keep the\\r\\ndeluge out, I sat behind my door in my little house, which was all entry, and\\r\\nthoroughly enjoyed its protection. In one heavy thunder shower the lightning\\r\\nstruck a large pitch-pine across the pond, making a very conspicuous and\\r\\nperfectly regular spiral groove from top to bottom, an inch or more deep, and\\r\\nfour or five inches wide, as you would groove a walking-stick. I passed it\\r\\nagain the other day, and was struck with awe on looking up and beholding that\\r\\nmark, now more distinct than ever, where a terrific and resistless bolt came\\r\\ndown out of the harmless sky eight years ago. Men frequently say to me,\\r\\n“I should think you would feel lonesome down there, and want to be nearer\\r\\nto folks, rainy and snowy days and nights especially.” I am tempted to\\r\\nreply to such,—This whole earth which we inhabit is but a point in space.\\r\\nHow far apart, think you, dwell the two most distant inhabitants of yonder\\r\\nstar, the breadth of whose disk cannot be appreciated by our instruments? Why\\r\\nshould I feel lonely? is not our planet in the Milky Way? This which you put\\r\\nseems to me not to be the most important question. What sort of space is that\\r\\nwhich separates a man from his fellows and makes him solitary? I have found\\r\\nthat no exertion of the legs can bring two minds much nearer to one another.\\r\\nWhat do we want most to dwell near to? Not to many men surely, the depot, the\\r\\npost-office, the bar-room, the meeting-house, the school-house, the grocery,\\r\\nBeacon Hill, or the Five Points, where men most congregate, but to the\\r\\nperennial source of our life, whence in all our experience we have found that\\r\\nto issue, as the willow stands near the water and sends out its roots in that\\r\\ndirection. This will vary with different natures, but this is the place where a\\r\\nwise man will dig his cellar.... I one evening overtook one of my townsmen, who\\r\\nhas accumulated what is called “a handsome property,”—though I\\r\\nnever got a fair view of it,—on the Walden road, driving a pair of\\r\\ncattle to market, who inquired of me how I could bring my mind to give up so\\r\\nmany of the comforts of life. I answered that I was very sure I liked it\\r\\npassably well; I was not joking. And so I went home to my bed, and left him to\\r\\npick his way through the darkness and the mud to Brighton,—or\\r\\nBright-town,—which place he would reach some time in the morning.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAny prospect of awakening or coming to life to a dead man makes indifferent all\\r\\ntimes and places. The place where that may occur is always the same, and\\r\\nindescribably pleasant to all our senses. For the most part we allow only\\r\\noutlying and transient circumstances to make our occasions. They are, in fact,\\r\\nthe cause of our distraction. Nearest to all things is that power which\\r\\nfashions their being. Next to us the grandest laws are continually being\\r\\nexecuted. Next to us is not the workman whom we have hired, with whom we\\r\\nlove so well to talk, but the workman whose work we are.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How vast and profound is the influence of the subtile powers of Heaven\\r\\nand of Earth!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We seek to perceive them, and we do not see them; we seek to hear them,\\r\\nand we do not hear them; identified with the substance of things, they cannot\\r\\nbe separated from them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They cause that in all the universe men purify and sanctify their\\r\\nhearts, and clothe themselves in their holiday garments to offer sacrifices and\\r\\noblations to their ancestors. It is an ocean of subtile intelligences. They are\\r\\nevery where, above us, on our left, on our right; they environ us on all\\r\\nsides.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe are the subjects of an experiment which is not a little interesting to me.\\r\\nCan we not do without the society of our gossips a little while under these\\r\\ncircumstances,—have our own thoughts to cheer us? Confucius says truly,\\r\\n“Virtue does not remain as an abandoned orphan; it must of necessity have\\r\\nneighbors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith thinking we may be beside ourselves in a sane sense. By a conscious effort\\r\\nof the mind we can stand aloof from actions and their consequences; and all\\r\\nthings, good and bad, go by us like a torrent. We are not wholly involved in\\r\\nNature. I may be either the drift-wood in the stream, or Indra in the sky\\r\\nlooking down on it. I may be affected by a theatrical exhibition; on the\\r\\nother hand, I may not be affected by an actual event which appears to\\r\\nconcern me much more. I only know myself as a human entity; the scene, so to\\r\\nspeak, of thoughts and affections; and am sensible of a certain doubleness by\\r\\nwhich I can stand as remote from myself as from another. However intense my\\r\\nexperience, I am conscious of the presence and criticism of a part of me,\\r\\nwhich, as it were, is not a part of me, but spectator, sharing no experience,\\r\\nbut taking note of it; and that is no more I than it is you. When the play, it\\r\\nmay be the tragedy, of life is over, the spectator goes his way. It was a kind\\r\\nof fiction, a work of the imagination only, so far as he was concerned. This\\r\\ndoubleness may easily make us poor neighbors and friends sometimes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company,\\r\\neven with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I\\r\\nnever found the companion that was so companionable as solitude. We are for the\\r\\nmost part more lonely when we go abroad among men than when we stay in our\\r\\nchambers. A man thinking or working is always alone, let him be where he will.\\r\\nSolitude is not measured by the miles of space that intervene between a man and\\r\\nhis fellows. The really diligent student in one of the crowded hives of\\r\\nCambridge College is as solitary as a dervish in the desert. The farmer can\\r\\nwork alone in the field or the woods all day, hoeing or chopping, and not feel\\r\\nlonesome, because he is employed; but when he comes home at night he cannot sit\\r\\ndown in a room alone, at the mercy of his thoughts, but must be where he can\\r\\n“see the folks,” and recreate, and as he thinks remunerate\\r\\nhimself for his day’s solitude; and hence he wonders how the student can\\r\\nsit alone in the house all night and most of the day without ennui and\\r\\n“the blues;” but he does not realize that the student, though in\\r\\nthe house, is still at work in his field, and chopping in his\\r\\nwoods, as the farmer in his, and in turn seeks the same recreation and society\\r\\nthat the latter does, though it may be a more condensed form of it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSociety is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not having had\\r\\ntime to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a\\r\\nday, and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are. We\\r\\nhave had to agree on a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness,\\r\\nto make this frequent meeting tolerable and that we need not come to open war.\\r\\nWe meet at the post-office, and at the sociable, and about the fireside every\\r\\nnight; we live thick and are in each other’s way, and stumble over one\\r\\nanother, and I think that we thus lose some respect for one another. Certainly\\r\\nless frequency would suffice for all important and hearty communications.\\r\\nConsider the girls in a factory,—never alone, hardly in their dreams. It\\r\\nwould be better if there were but one inhabitant to a square mile, as where I\\r\\nlive. The value of a man is not in his skin, that we should touch him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have heard of a man lost in the woods and dying of famine and exhaustion at\\r\\nthe foot of a tree, whose loneliness was relieved by the grotesque visions with\\r\\nwhich, owing to bodily weakness, his diseased imagination surrounded him, and\\r\\nwhich he believed to be real. So also, owing to bodily and mental health and\\r\\nstrength, we may be continually cheered by a like but more normal and natural\\r\\nsociety, and come to know that we are never alone.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have a great deal of company in my house; especially in the morning, when\\r\\nnobody calls. Let me suggest a few comparisons, that some one may convey an\\r\\nidea of my situation. I am no more lonely than the loon in the pond that laughs\\r\\nso loud, or than Walden Pond itself. What company has that lonely lake, I pray?\\r\\nAnd yet it has not the blue devils, but the blue angels in it, in the azure\\r\\ntint of its waters. The sun is alone, except in thick weather, when there\\r\\nsometimes appear to be two, but one is a mock sun. God is alone,—but the\\r\\ndevil, he is far from being alone; he sees a great deal of company; he is\\r\\nlegion. I am no more lonely than a single mullein or dandelion in a pasture, or\\r\\na bean leaf, or sorrel, or a horse-fly, or a bumble-bee. I am no more lonely\\r\\nthan the Mill Brook, or a weathercock, or the north star, or the south wind, or\\r\\nan April shower, or a January thaw, or the first spider in a new house.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have occasional visits in the long winter evenings, when the snow falls fast\\r\\nand the wind howls in the wood, from an old settler and original proprietor,\\r\\nwho is reported to have dug Walden Pond, and stoned it, and fringed it with\\r\\npine woods; who tells me stories of old time and of new eternity; and between\\r\\nus we manage to pass a cheerful evening with social mirth and pleasant views of\\r\\nthings, even without apples or cider,—a most wise and humorous friend,\\r\\nwhom I love much, who keeps himself more secret than ever did Goffe or Whalley;\\r\\nand though he is thought to be dead, none can show where he is buried. An\\r\\nelderly dame, too, dwells in my neighborhood, invisible to most persons, in\\r\\nwhose odorous herb garden I love to stroll sometimes, gathering simples and\\r\\nlistening to her fables; for she has a genius of unequalled fertility, and her\\r\\nmemory runs back farther than mythology, and she can tell me the original of\\r\\nevery fable, and on what fact every one is founded, for the incidents occurred\\r\\nwhen she was young. A ruddy and lusty old dame, who delights in all weathers\\r\\nand seasons, and is likely to outlive all her children yet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe indescribable innocence and beneficence of Nature,—of sun and wind and\\r\\nrain, of summer and winter,—such health, such cheer, they afford forever!\\r\\nand such sympathy have they ever with our race, that all Nature would be\\r\\naffected, and the sun’s brightness fade, and the winds would sigh\\r\\nhumanely, and the clouds rain tears, and the woods shed their leaves and put on\\r\\nmourning in midsummer, if any man should ever for a just cause grieve. Shall I\\r\\nnot have intelligence with the earth? Am I not partly leaves and vegetable\\r\\nmould myself?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhat is the pill which will keep us well, serene, contented? Not my or thy\\r\\ngreat-grandfather’s, but our great-grandmother Nature’s universal,\\r\\nvegetable, botanic medicines, by which she has kept herself young always,\\r\\noutlived so many old Parrs in her day, and fed her health with their decaying\\r\\nfatness. For my panacea, instead of one of those quack vials of a mixture\\r\\ndipped from Acheron and the Dead Sea, which come out of those long shallow\\r\\nblack-schooner looking wagons which we sometimes see made to carry bottles, let\\r\\nme have a draught of undiluted morning air. Morning air! If men will not drink\\r\\nof this at the fountain-head of the day, why, then, we must even bottle up some\\r\\nand sell it in the shops, for the benefit of those who have lost their\\r\\nsubscription ticket to morning time in this world. But remember, it will not\\r\\nkeep quite till noon-day even in the coolest cellar, but drive out the stopples\\r\\nlong ere that and follow westward the steps of Aurora. I am no worshipper of\\r\\nHygeia, who was the daughter of that old herb-doctor Ã\\x86sculapius, and who is\\r\\nrepresented on monuments holding a serpent in one hand, and in the other a cup\\r\\nout of which the serpent sometimes drinks; but rather of Hebe, cupbearer to\\r\\nJupiter, who was the daughter of Juno and wild lettuce, and who had the power\\r\\nof restoring gods and men to the vigor of youth. She was probably the only\\r\\nthoroughly sound-conditioned, healthy, and robust young lady that ever walked\\r\\nthe globe, and wherever she came it was spring.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Visitors\\n\\r\\nI think that I love society as much as most, and am ready enough to fasten\\r\\nmyself like a bloodsucker for the time to any full-blooded man that comes in my\\r\\nway. I am naturally no hermit, but might possibly sit out the sturdiest\\r\\nfrequenter of the bar-room, if my business called me thither.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had three chairs in my house; one for solitude, two for friendship, three for\\r\\nsociety. When visitors came in larger and unexpected numbers there was but the\\r\\nthird chair for them all, but they generally economized the room by standing\\r\\nup. It is surprising how many great men and women a small house will contain. I\\r\\nhave had twenty-five or thirty souls, with their bodies, at once under my roof,\\r\\nand yet we often parted without being aware that we had come very near to one\\r\\nanother. Many of our houses, both public and private, with their almost\\r\\ninnumerable apartments, their huge halls and their cellars for the storage of\\r\\nwines and other munitions of peace, appear to me extravagantly large for their\\r\\ninhabitants. They are so vast and magnificent that the latter seem to be only\\r\\nvermin which infest them. I am surprised when the herald blows his summons\\r\\nbefore some Tremont or Astor or Middlesex House, to see come creeping out over\\r\\nthe piazza for all inhabitants a ridiculous mouse, which soon again slinks into\\r\\nsome hole in the pavement.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne inconvenience I sometimes experienced in so small a house, the difficulty\\r\\nof getting to a sufficient distance from my guest when we began to utter the\\r\\nbig thoughts in big words. You want room for your thoughts to get into sailing\\r\\ntrim and run a course or two before they make their port. The bullet of your\\r\\nthought must have overcome its lateral and ricochet motion and fallen into its\\r\\nlast and steady course before it reaches the ear of the hearer, else it may\\r\\nplough out again through the side of his head. Also, our sentences wanted room\\r\\nto unfold and form their columns in the interval. Individuals, like nations,\\r\\nmust have suitable broad and natural boundaries, even a considerable neutral\\r\\nground, between them. I have found it a singular luxury to talk across the pond\\r\\nto a companion on the opposite side. In my house we were so near that we could\\r\\nnot begin to hear,—we could not speak low enough to be heard; as when you\\r\\nthrow two stones into calm water so near that they break each other’s\\r\\nundulations. If we are merely loquacious and loud talkers, then we can afford\\r\\nto stand very near together, cheek by jowl, and feel each other’s breath;\\r\\nbut if we speak reservedly and thoughtfully, we want to be farther apart, that\\r\\nall animal heat and moisture may have a chance to evaporate. If we would enjoy\\r\\nthe most intimate society with that in each of us which is without, or above,\\r\\nbeing spoken to, we must not only be silent, but commonly so far apart bodily\\r\\nthat we cannot possibly hear each other’s voice in any case. Referred to\\r\\nthis standard, speech is for the convenience of those who are hard of hearing;\\r\\nbut there are many fine things which we cannot say if we have to shout. As the\\r\\nconversation began to assume a loftier and grander tone, we gradually shoved\\r\\nour chairs farther apart till they touched the wall in opposite corners, and\\r\\nthen commonly there was not room enough.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy “best” room, however, my withdrawing room, always ready for\\r\\ncompany, on whose carpet the sun rarely fell, was the pine wood behind my\\r\\nhouse. Thither in summer days, when distinguished guests came, I took them, and\\r\\na priceless domestic swept the floor and dusted the furniture and kept the\\r\\nthings in order.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIf one guest came he sometimes partook of my frugal meal, and it was no\\r\\ninterruption to conversation to be stirring a hasty-pudding, or watching the\\r\\nrising and maturing of a loaf of bread in the ashes, in the mean while. But if\\r\\ntwenty came and sat in my house there was nothing said about dinner, though\\r\\nthere might be bread enough for two, more than if eating were a forsaken habit;\\r\\nbut we naturally practised abstinence; and this was never felt to be an offence\\r\\nagainst hospitality, but the most proper and considerate course. The waste and\\r\\ndecay of physical life, which so often needs repair, seemed miraculously\\r\\nretarded in such a case, and the vital vigor stood its ground. I could\\r\\nentertain thus a thousand as well as twenty; and if any ever went away\\r\\ndisappointed or hungry from my house when they found me at home, they may\\r\\ndepend upon it that I sympathized with them at least. So easy is it, though\\r\\nmany housekeepers doubt it, to establish new and better customs in the place of\\r\\nthe old. You need not rest your reputation on the dinners you give. For my own\\r\\npart, I was never so effectually deterred from frequenting a man’s house,\\r\\nby any kind of Cerberus whatever, as by the parade one made about dining me,\\r\\nwhich I took to be a very polite and roundabout hint never to trouble him so\\r\\nagain. I think I shall never revisit those scenes. I should be proud to have\\r\\nfor the motto of my cabin those lines of Spenser which one of my visitors\\r\\ninscribed on a yellow walnut leaf for a card:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“ArrivÃ©d there, the little house they fill,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Ne looke for entertainment where none was;\\r\\nRest is their feast, and all things at their will:\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0The noblest mind the best contentment has.”\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Winslow, afterward governor of the Plymouth Colony, went with a companion\\r\\non a visit of ceremony to Massasoit on foot through the woods, and arrived\\r\\ntired and hungry at his lodge, they were well received by the king, but nothing\\r\\nwas said about eating that day. When the night arrived, to quote their own\\r\\nwords,—“He laid us on the bed with himself and his wife, they at the\\r\\none end and we at the other, it being only planks laid a foot from the ground,\\r\\nand a thin mat upon them. Two more of his chief men, for want of room, pressed\\r\\nby and upon us; so that we were worse weary of our lodging than of our\\r\\njourney.” At one o’clock the next day Massasoit “brought two\\r\\nfishes that he had shot,” about thrice as big as a bream; “these\\r\\nbeing boiled, there were at least forty looked for a share in them. The most\\r\\nate of them. This meal only we had in two nights and a day; and had not one of\\r\\nus bought a partridge, we had taken our journey fasting.” Fearing that\\r\\nthey would be light-headed for want of food and also sleep, owing to “the\\r\\nsavages’ barbarous singing, (for they used to sing themselves\\r\\nasleep,)” and that they might get home while they had strength to travel,\\r\\nthey departed. As for lodging, it is true they were but poorly entertained,\\r\\nthough what they found an inconvenience was no doubt intended for an honor; but\\r\\nas far as eating was concerned, I do not see how the Indians could have done\\r\\nbetter. They had nothing to eat themselves, and they were wiser than to think\\r\\nthat apologies could supply the place of food to their guests; so they drew\\r\\ntheir belts tighter and said nothing about it. Another time when Winslow\\r\\nvisited them, it being a season of plenty with them, there was no deficiency in\\r\\nthis respect.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs for men, they will hardly fail one any where. I had more visitors while I\\r\\nlived in the woods than at any other period in my life; I mean that I had some.\\r\\nI met several there under more favorable circumstances than I could any where\\r\\nelse. But fewer came to see me on trivial business. In this respect, my company\\r\\nwas winnowed by my mere distance from town. I had withdrawn so far within the\\r\\ngreat ocean of solitude, into which the rivers of society empty, that for the\\r\\nmost part, so far as my needs were concerned, only the finest sediment was\\r\\ndeposited around me. Beside, there were wafted to me evidences of unexplored\\r\\nand uncultivated continents on the other side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWho should come to my lodge this morning but a true Homeric or Paphlagonian\\r\\nman,—he had so suitable and poetic a name that I am sorry I cannot print\\r\\nit here,—a Canadian, a woodchopper and post-maker, who can hole fifty\\r\\nposts in a day, who made his last supper on a woodchuck which his dog caught.\\r\\nHe, too, has heard of Homer, and, “if it were not for books,” would\\r\\n“not know what to do rainy days,” though perhaps he has not read\\r\\none wholly through for many rainy seasons. Some priest who could pronounce the\\r\\nGreek itself taught him to read his verse in the testament in his native parish\\r\\nfar away; and now I must translate to him, while he holds the book,\\r\\nAchilles’ reproof to Patroclus for his sad countenance.—“Why\\r\\nare you in tears, Patroclus, like a young girl?”—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Or have you alone heard some news from Phthia?\\r\\nThey say that MenÅ\\x93tius lives yet, son of Actor,\\r\\nAnd Peleus lives, son of Ã\\x86acus, among the Myrmidons,\\r\\nEither of whom having died, we should greatly grieve.”\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nHe says, “That’s good.” He has a great bundle of white-oak\\r\\nbark under his arm for a sick man, gathered this Sunday morning. “I\\r\\nsuppose there’s no harm in going after such a thing to-day,” says\\r\\nhe. To him Homer was a great writer, though what his writing was about he did\\r\\nnot know. A more simple and natural man it would be hard to find. Vice and\\r\\ndisease, which cast such a sombre moral hue over the world, seemed to have\\r\\nhardly any existence for him. He was about twenty-eight years old, and had left\\r\\nCanada and his father’s house a dozen years before to work in the States,\\r\\nand earn money to buy a farm with at last, perhaps in his native country. He\\r\\nwas cast in the coarsest mould; a stout but sluggish body, yet gracefully\\r\\ncarried, with a thick sunburnt neck, dark bushy hair, and dull sleepy blue\\r\\neyes, which were occasionally lit up with expression. He wore a flat gray cloth\\r\\ncap, a dingy wool-colored greatcoat, and cowhide boots. He was a great consumer\\r\\nof meat, usually carrying his dinner to his work a couple of miles past my\\r\\nhouse,—for he chopped all summer,—in a tin pail; cold meats, often\\r\\ncold woodchucks, and coffee in a stone bottle which dangled by a string from\\r\\nhis belt; and sometimes he offered me a drink. He came along early, crossing my\\r\\nbean-field, though without anxiety or haste to get to his work, such as Yankees\\r\\nexhibit. He wasn’t a-going to hurt himself. He didn’t care if he\\r\\nonly earned his board. Frequently he would leave his dinner in the bushes, when\\r\\nhis dog had caught a woodchuck by the way, and go back a mile and a half to\\r\\ndress it and leave it in the cellar of the house where he boarded, after\\r\\ndeliberating first for half an hour whether he could not sink it in the pond\\r\\nsafely till nightfall,—loving to dwell long upon these themes. He would\\r\\nsay, as he went by in the morning, “How thick the pigeons are! If working\\r\\nevery day were not my trade, I could get all the meat I should want by\\r\\nhunting,—pigeons, woodchucks, rabbits, partridges,—by gosh! I could\\r\\nget all I should want for a week in one day.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe was a skilful chopper, and indulged in some flourishes and ornaments in his\\r\\nart. He cut his trees level and close to the ground, that the sprouts which\\r\\ncame up afterward might be more vigorous and a sled might slide over the\\r\\nstumps; and instead of leaving a whole tree to support his corded wood, he\\r\\nwould pare it away to a slender stake or splinter which you could break off\\r\\nwith your hand at last.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe interested me because he was so quiet and solitary and so happy withal; a\\r\\nwell of good humor and contentment which overflowed at his eyes. His mirth was\\r\\nwithout alloy. Sometimes I saw him at his work in the woods, felling trees, and\\r\\nhe would greet me with a laugh of inexpressible satisfaction, and a salutation\\r\\nin Canadian French, though he spoke English as well. When I approached him he\\r\\nwould suspend his work, and with half-suppressed mirth lie along the trunk of a\\r\\npine which he had felled, and, peeling off the inner bark, roll it up into a\\r\\nball and chew it while he laughed and talked. Such an exuberance of animal\\r\\nspirits had he that he sometimes tumbled down and rolled on the ground with\\r\\nlaughter at any thing which made him think and tickled him. Looking round upon\\r\\nthe trees he would exclaim,—“By George! I can enjoy myself well\\r\\nenough here chopping; I want no better sport.” Sometimes, when at\\r\\nleisure, he amused himself all day in the woods with a pocket pistol, firing\\r\\nsalutes to himself at regular intervals as he walked. In the winter he had a\\r\\nfire by which at noon he warmed his coffee in a kettle; and as he sat on a log\\r\\nto eat his dinner the chickadees would sometimes come round and alight on his\\r\\narm and peck at the potato in his fingers; and he said that he “liked to\\r\\nhave the little fellers about him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn him the animal man chiefly was developed. In physical endurance and\\r\\ncontentment he was cousin to the pine and the rock. I asked him once if he was\\r\\nnot sometimes tired at night, after working all day; and he answered, with a\\r\\nsincere and serious look, “Gorrappit, I never was tired in my\\r\\nlife.” But the intellectual and what is called spiritual man in him were\\r\\nslumbering as in an infant. He had been instructed only in that innocent and\\r\\nineffectual way in which the Catholic priests teach the aborigines, by which\\r\\nthe pupil is never educated to the degree of consciousness, but only to the\\r\\ndegree of trust and reverence, and a child is not made a man, but kept a child.\\r\\nWhen Nature made him, she gave him a strong body and contentment for his\\r\\nportion, and propped him on every side with reverence and reliance, that he\\r\\nmight live out his threescore years and ten a child. He was so genuine and\\r\\nunsophisticated that no introduction would serve to introduce him, more than if\\r\\nyou introduced a woodchuck to your neighbor. He had got to find him out as you\\r\\ndid. He would not play any part. Men paid him wages for work, and so helped to\\r\\nfeed and clothe him; but he never exchanged opinions with them. He was so\\r\\nsimply and naturally humble—if he can be called humble who never\\r\\naspires—that humility was no distinct quality in him, nor could he\\r\\nconceive of it. Wiser men were demigods to him. If you told him that such a one\\r\\nwas coming, he did as if he thought that any thing so grand would expect nothing\\r\\nof himself, but take all the responsibility on itself, and let him be forgotten\\r\\nstill. He never heard the sound of praise. He particularly reverenced the\\r\\nwriter and the preacher. Their performances were miracles. When I told him that\\r\\nI wrote considerably, he thought for a long time that it was merely the\\r\\nhandwriting which I meant, for he could write a remarkably good hand himself. I\\r\\nsometimes found the name of his native parish handsomely written in the snow by\\r\\nthe highway, with the proper French accent, and knew that he had passed. I\\r\\nasked him if he ever wished to write his thoughts. He said that he had read and\\r\\nwritten letters for those who could not, but he never tried to write\\r\\nthoughts,—no, he could not, he could not tell what to put first, it would\\r\\nkill him, and then there was spelling to be attended to at the same time!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI heard that a distinguished wise man and reformer asked him if he did not want\\r\\nthe world to be changed; but he answered with a chuckle of surprise in his\\r\\nCanadian accent, not knowing that the question had ever been entertained\\r\\nbefore, “No, I like it well enough.” It would have suggested many\\r\\nthings to a philosopher to have dealings with him. To a stranger he appeared to\\r\\nknow nothing of things in general; yet I sometimes saw in him a man whom I had\\r\\nnot seen before, and I did not know whether he was as wise as Shakespeare or as\\r\\nsimply ignorant as a child, whether to suspect him of a fine poetic\\r\\nconsciousness or of stupidity. A townsman told me that when he met him\\r\\nsauntering through the village in his small close-fitting cap, and whistling to\\r\\nhimself, he reminded him of a prince in disguise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis only books were an almanac and an arithmetic, in which last he was\\r\\nconsiderably expert. The former was a sort of cyclopÃ¦dia to him, which he\\r\\nsupposed to contain an abstract of human knowledge, as indeed it does to a\\r\\nconsiderable extent. I loved to sound him on the various reforms of the day,\\r\\nand he never failed to look at them in the most simple and practical light. He\\r\\nhad never heard of such things before. Could he do without factories? I asked.\\r\\nHe had worn the home-made Vermont gray, he said, and that was good. Could he\\r\\ndispense with tea and coffee? Did this country afford any beverage beside\\r\\nwater? He had soaked hemlock leaves in water and drank it, and thought that was\\r\\nbetter than water in warm weather. When I asked him if he could do without\\r\\nmoney, he showed the convenience of money in such a way as to suggest and\\r\\ncoincide with the most philosophical accounts of the origin of this\\r\\ninstitution, and the very derivation of the word pecunia. If an ox were\\r\\nhis property, and he wished to get needles and thread at the store, he thought\\r\\nit would be inconvenient and impossible soon to go on mortgaging some portion\\r\\nof the creature each time to that amount. He could defend many institutions\\r\\nbetter than any philosopher, because, in describing them as they concerned him,\\r\\nhe gave the true reason for their prevalence, and speculation had not suggested\\r\\nto him any other. At another time, hearing Plato’s definition of a\\r\\nman,—a biped without feathers,—and that one exhibited a cock\\r\\nplucked and called it Plato’s man, he thought it an important difference\\r\\nthat the knees bent the wrong way. He would sometimes exclaim,\\r\\n“How I love to talk! By George, I could talk all day!” I asked him\\r\\nonce, when I had not seen him for many months, if he had got a new idea this\\r\\nsummer. “Good Lord,” said he, “a man that has to work as I\\r\\ndo, if he does not forget the ideas he has had, he will do well. May be the man\\r\\nyou hoe with is inclined to race; then, by gorry, your mind must be there; you\\r\\nthink of weeds.” He would sometimes ask me first on such occasions, if I\\r\\nhad made any improvement. One winter day I asked him if he was always satisfied\\r\\nwith himself, wishing to suggest a substitute within him for the priest\\r\\nwithout, and some higher motive for living. “Satisfied!” said he;\\r\\n“some men are satisfied with one thing, and some with another. One man,\\r\\nperhaps, if he has got enough, will be satisfied to sit all day with his back\\r\\nto the fire and his belly to the table, by George!” Yet I never, by any\\r\\nmanÅ\\x93uvring, could get him to take the spiritual view of things; the highest\\r\\nthat he appeared to conceive of was a simple expediency, such as you might\\r\\nexpect an animal to appreciate; and this, practically, is true of most men. If\\r\\nI suggested any improvement in his mode of life, he merely answered, without\\r\\nexpressing any regret, that it was too late. Yet he thoroughly believed in\\r\\nhonesty and the like virtues.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was a certain positive originality, however slight, to be detected in\\r\\nhim, and I occasionally observed that he was thinking for himself and\\r\\nexpressing his own opinion, a phenomenon so rare that I would any day walk ten\\r\\nmiles to observe it, and it amounted to the re-origination of many of the\\r\\ninstitutions of society. Though he hesitated, and perhaps failed to express\\r\\nhimself distinctly, he always had a presentable thought behind. Yet his\\r\\nthinking was so primitive and immersed in his animal life, that, though more\\r\\npromising than a merely learned man’s, it rarely ripened to any thing\\r\\nwhich can be reported. He suggested that there might be men of genius in the\\r\\nlowest grades of life, however permanently humble and illiterate, who take\\r\\ntheir own view always, or do not pretend to see at all; who are as bottomless\\r\\neven as Walden Pond was thought to be, though they may be dark and muddy.\\n\\n\\r\\nMany a traveller came out of his way to see me and the inside of my house, and,\\r\\nas an excuse for calling, asked for a glass of water. I told them that I drank\\r\\nat the pond, and pointed thither, offering to lend them a dipper. Far off as I\\r\\nlived, I was not exempted from the annual visitation which occurs, methinks,\\r\\nabout the first of April, when every body is on the move; and I had my share of\\r\\ngood luck, though there were some curious specimens among my visitors.\\r\\nHalf-witted men from the almshouse and elsewhere came to see me; but I\\r\\nendeavored to make them exercise all the wit they had, and make their\\r\\nconfessions to me; in such cases making wit the theme of our conversation; and\\r\\nso was compensated. Indeed, I found some of them to be wiser than the so called\\r\\noverseers of the poor and selectmen of the town, and thought it was time\\r\\nthat the tables were turned. With respect to wit, I learned that there was not\\r\\nmuch difference between the half and the whole. One day, in particular, an\\r\\ninoffensive, simple-minded pauper, whom with others I had often seen used as\\r\\nfencing stuff, standing or sitting on a bushel in the fields to keep cattle and\\r\\nhimself from straying, visited me, and expressed a wish to live as I did. He\\r\\ntold me, with the utmost simplicity and truth, quite superior, or rather\\r\\ninferior, to any thing that is called humility, that he was\\r\\n“deficient in intellect.” These were his words. The Lord had made\\r\\nhim so, yet he supposed the Lord cared as much for him as for another. “I\\r\\nhave always been so,” said he, “from my childhood; I never had much\\r\\nmind; I was not like other children; I am weak in the head. It was the\\r\\nLord’s will, I suppose.” And there he was to prove the truth of his\\r\\nwords. He was a metaphysical puzzle to me. I have rarely met a fellow-man on\\r\\nsuch promising ground,—it was so simple and sincere and so true all that\\r\\nhe said. And, true enough, in proportion as he appeared to humble himself was\\r\\nhe exalted. I did not know at first but it was the result of a wise policy. It\\r\\nseemed that from such a basis of truth and frankness as the poor weak-headed\\r\\npauper had laid, our intercourse might go forward to something better than the\\r\\nintercourse of sages.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had some guests from those not reckoned commonly among the town’s poor,\\r\\nbut who should be; who are among the world’s poor, at any rate; guests\\r\\nwho appeal, not to your hospitality, but to your hospitalality; who\\r\\nearnestly wish to be helped, and preface their appeal with the information that\\r\\nthey are resolved, for one thing, never to help themselves. I require of a\\r\\nvisitor that he be not actually starving, though he may have the very best\\r\\nappetite in the world, however he got it. Objects of charity are not guests.\\r\\nMen who did not know when their visit had terminated, though I went about my\\r\\nbusiness again, answering them from greater and greater remoteness. Men of\\r\\nalmost every degree of wit called on me in the migrating season. Some who had\\r\\nmore wits than they knew what to do with; runaway slaves with plantation\\r\\nmanners, who listened from time to time, like the fox in the fable, as if they\\r\\nheard the hounds a-baying on their track, and looked at me beseechingly, as\\r\\nmuch as to say,—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“O Christian, will you send me back?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne real runaway slave, among the rest, whom I helped to forward toward the\\r\\nnorthstar. Men of one idea, like a hen with one chicken, and that a duckling;\\r\\nmen of a thousand ideas, and unkempt heads, like those hens which are made to\\r\\ntake charge of a hundred chickens, all in pursuit of one bug, a score of them\\r\\nlost in every morning’s dew,—and become frizzled and mangy in\\r\\nconsequence; men of ideas instead of legs, a sort of intellectual centipede\\r\\nthat made you crawl all over. One man proposed a book in which visitors should\\r\\nwrite their names, as at the White Mountains; but, alas! I have too good a\\r\\nmemory to make that necessary.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI could not but notice some of the peculiarities of my visitors. Girls and boys\\r\\nand young women generally seemed glad to be in the woods. They looked in the\\r\\npond and at the flowers, and improved their time. Men of business, even\\r\\nfarmers, thought only of solitude and employment, and of the great distance at\\r\\nwhich I dwelt from something or other; and though they said that they loved a\\r\\nramble in the woods occasionally, it was obvious that they did not. Restless\\r\\ncommitted men, whose time was all taken up in getting a living or keeping it;\\r\\nministers who spoke of God as if they enjoyed a monopoly of the subject, who\\r\\ncould not bear all kinds of opinions; doctors, lawyers, uneasy housekeepers who\\r\\npried into my cupboard and bed when I was out,—how came Mrs.\\r\\n—— to know that my sheets were not as clean as hers?—young\\r\\nmen who had ceased to be young, and had concluded that it was safest to follow\\r\\nthe beaten track of the professions,—all these generally said that it was\\r\\nnot possible to do so much good in my position. Ay! there was the rub. The old\\r\\nand infirm and the timid, of whatever age or sex, thought most of sickness, and\\r\\nsudden accident and death; to them life seemed full of danger,—what\\r\\ndanger is there if you don’t think of any?—and they thought that a\\r\\nprudent man would carefully select the safest position, where Dr. B. might be\\r\\non hand at a moment’s warning. To them the village was literally a\\r\\ncom-munity, a league for mutual defence, and you would suppose that they\\r\\nwould not go a-huckleberrying without a medicine chest. The amount of it is, if\\r\\na man is alive, there is always danger that he may die, though the\\r\\ndanger must be allowed to be less in proportion as he is dead-and-alive to\\r\\nbegin with. A man sits as many risks as he runs. Finally, there were the\\r\\nself-styled reformers, the greatest bores of all, who thought that I was\\r\\nforever singing,—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis is the house that I built;\\r\\nThis is the man that lives in the house that I built;\\n\\n\\r\\nbut they did not know that the third line was,—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThese are the folks that worry the man\\r\\nThat lives in the house that I built.\\n\\n\\r\\nI did not fear the hen-harriers, for I kept no chickens; but I feared the\\r\\nmen-harriers rather.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI had more cheering visitors than the last. Children come a-berrying, railroad\\r\\nmen taking a Sunday morning walk in clean shirts, fishermen and hunters, poets\\r\\nand philosophers; in short, all honest pilgrims, who came out to the woods for\\r\\nfreedom’s sake, and really left the village behind, I was ready to greet\\r\\nwith,—“Welcome, Englishmen! welcome, Englishmen!” for I had\\r\\nhad communication with that race.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The Bean-Field\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile my beans, the length of whose rows, added together, was seven miles\\r\\nalready planted, were impatient to be hoed, for the earliest had grown\\r\\nconsiderably before the latest were in the ground; indeed they were not easily\\r\\nto be put off. What was the meaning of this so steady and self-respecting, this\\r\\nsmall Herculean labor, I knew not. I came to love my rows, my beans, though so\\r\\nmany more than I wanted. They attached me to the earth, and so I got strength\\r\\nlike AntÃ¦us. But why should I raise them? Only Heaven knows. This was my\\r\\ncurious labor all summer,—to make this portion of the earth’s\\r\\nsurface, which had yielded only cinquefoil, blackberries, johnswort, and the\\r\\nlike, before, sweet wild fruits and pleasant flowers, produce instead this\\r\\npulse. What shall I learn of beans or beans of me? I cherish them, I hoe them,\\r\\nearly and late I have an eye to them; and this is my day’s work. It is a\\r\\nfine broad leaf to look on. My auxiliaries are the dews and rains which water\\r\\nthis dry soil, and what fertility is in the soil itself, which for the most\\r\\npart is lean and effete. My enemies are worms, cool days, and most of all\\r\\nwoodchucks. The last have nibbled for me a quarter of an acre clean. But what\\r\\nright had I to oust johnswort and the rest, and break up their ancient herb\\r\\ngarden? Soon, however, the remaining beans will be too tough for them, and go\\r\\nforward to meet new foes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I was four years old, as I well remember, I was brought from Boston to\\r\\nthis my native town, through these very woods and this field, to the pond. It\\r\\nis one of the oldest scenes stamped on my memory. And now to-night my flute has\\r\\nwaked the echoes over that very water. The pines still stand here older than I;\\r\\nor, if some have fallen, I have cooked my supper with their stumps, and a new\\r\\ngrowth is rising all around, preparing another aspect for new infant eyes.\\r\\nAlmost the same johnswort springs from the same perennial root in this pasture,\\r\\nand even I have at length helped to clothe that fabulous landscape of my infant\\r\\ndreams, and one of the results of my presence and influence is seen in these\\r\\nbean leaves, corn blades, and potato vines.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI planted about two acres and a half of upland; and as it was only about\\r\\nfifteen years since the land was cleared, and I myself had got out two or three\\r\\ncords of stumps, I did not give it any manure; but in the course of the summer\\r\\nit appeared by the arrowheads which I turned up in hoeing, that an extinct\\r\\nnation had anciently dwelt here and planted corn and beans ere white men came\\r\\nto clear the land, and so, to some extent, had exhausted the soil for this very\\r\\ncrop.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBefore yet any woodchuck or squirrel had run across the road, or the sun had\\r\\ngot above the shrub oaks, while all the dew was on, though the farmers warned\\r\\nme against it,—I would advise you to do all your work if possible while\\r\\nthe dew is on,—I began to level the ranks of haughty weeds in my\\r\\nbean-field and throw dust upon their heads. Early in the morning I worked\\r\\nbarefooted, dabbling like a plastic artist in the dewy and crumbling sand, but\\r\\nlater in the day the sun blistered my feet. There the sun lighted me to hoe\\r\\nbeans, pacing slowly backward and forward over that yellow gravelly upland,\\r\\nbetween the long green rows, fifteen rods, the one end terminating in a shrub\\r\\noak copse where I could rest in the shade, the other in a blackberry field\\r\\nwhere the green berries deepened their tints by the time I had made another\\r\\nbout. Removing the weeds, putting fresh soil about the bean stems, and\\r\\nencouraging this weed which I had sown, making the yellow soil express its\\r\\nsummer thought in bean leaves and blossoms rather than in wormwood and piper\\r\\nand millet grass, making the earth say beans instead of grass,—this was my\\r\\ndaily work. As I had little aid from horses or cattle, or hired men or boys, or\\r\\nimproved implements of husbandry, I was much slower, and became much more\\r\\nintimate with my beans than usual. But labor of the hands, even when pursued to\\r\\nthe verge of drudgery, is perhaps never the worst form of idleness. It has a\\r\\nconstant and imperishable moral, and to the scholar it yields a classic result.\\r\\nA very agricola laboriosus was I to travellers bound westward through\\r\\nLincoln and Wayland to nobody knows where; they sitting at their ease in gigs,\\r\\nwith elbows on knees, and reins loosely hanging in festoons; I the\\r\\nhome-staying, laborious native of the soil. But soon my homestead was out of\\r\\ntheir sight and thought. It was the only open and cultivated field for a great\\r\\ndistance on either side of the road; so they made the most of it; and sometimes\\r\\nthe man in the field heard more of travellers’ gossip and comment than\\r\\nwas meant for his ear: “Beans so late! peas so late!”—for I\\r\\ncontinued to plant when others had begun to hoe,—the ministerial\\r\\nhusbandman had not suspected it. “Corn, my boy, for fodder; corn for\\r\\nfodder.” “Does he live there?” asks the black bonnet\\r\\nof the gray coat; and the hard-featured farmer reins up his grateful dobbin to\\r\\ninquire what you are doing where he sees no manure in the furrow, and\\r\\nrecommends a little chip dirt, or any little waste stuff, or it may be ashes or\\r\\nplaster. But here were two acres and a half of furrows, and only a hoe for cart\\r\\nand two hands to draw it,—there being an aversion to other carts and\\r\\nhorses,—and chip dirt far away. Fellow-travellers as they rattled by\\r\\ncompared it aloud with the fields which they had passed, so that I came to know\\r\\nhow I stood in the agricultural world. This was one field not in Mr.\\r\\nColeman’s report. And, by the way, who estimates the value of the crop\\r\\nwhich nature yields in the still wilder fields unimproved by man? The crop of\\r\\nEnglish hay is carefully weighed, the moisture calculated, the silicates\\r\\nand the potash; but in all dells and pond holes in the woods and pastures and\\r\\nswamps grows a rich and various crop only unreaped by man. Mine was, as it\\r\\nwere, the connecting link between wild and cultivated fields; as some states\\r\\nare civilized, and others half-civilized, and others savage or barbarous, so my\\r\\nfield was, though not in a bad sense, a half-cultivated field. They were beans\\r\\ncheerfully returning to their wild and primitive state that I cultivated, and\\r\\nmy hoe played the Ranz des Vaches for them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNear at hand, upon the topmost spray of a birch, sings the\\r\\nbrown-thrasher—or red mavis, as some love to call him—all the\\r\\nmorning, glad of your society, that would find out another farmer’s field\\r\\nif yours were not here. While you are planting the seed, he\\r\\ncries,—“Drop it, drop it,—cover it up, cover it up,—pull\\r\\nit up, pull it up, pull it up.” But this was not corn, and so it was safe\\r\\nfrom such enemies as he. You may wonder what his rigmarole, his amateur\\r\\nPaganini performances on one string or on twenty, have to do with your\\r\\nplanting, and yet prefer it to leached ashes or plaster. It was a cheap sort of\\r\\ntop dressing in which I had entire faith.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I drew a still fresher soil about the rows with my hoe, I disturbed the\\r\\nashes of unchronicled nations who in primeval years lived under these heavens,\\r\\nand their small implements of war and hunting were brought to the light of this\\r\\nmodern day. They lay mingled with other natural stones, some of which bore the\\r\\nmarks of having been burned by Indian fires, and some by the sun, and also bits\\r\\nof pottery and glass brought hither by the recent cultivators of the soil. When\\r\\nmy hoe tinkled against the stones, that music echoed to the woods and the sky,\\r\\nand was an accompaniment to my labor which yielded an instant and immeasurable\\r\\ncrop. It was no longer beans that I hoed, nor I that hoed beans; and I\\r\\nremembered with as much pity as pride, if I remembered at all, my acquaintances\\r\\nwho had gone to the city to attend the oratorios. The night-hawk circled\\r\\noverhead in the sunny afternoons—for I sometimes made a day of\\r\\nit—like a mote in the eye, or in heaven’s eye, falling from time to\\r\\ntime with a swoop and a sound as if the heavens were rent, torn at last to very\\r\\nrags and tatters, and yet a seamless cope remained; small imps that fill the\\r\\nair and lay their eggs on the ground on bare sand or rocks on the tops of\\r\\nhills, where few have found them; graceful and slender like ripples caught up\\r\\nfrom the pond, as leaves are raised by the wind to float in the heavens; such\\r\\nkindredship is in Nature. The hawk is aerial brother of the wave which he sails\\r\\nover and surveys, those his perfect air-inflated wings answering to the\\r\\nelemental unfledged pinions of the sea. Or sometimes I watched a pair of\\r\\nhen-hawks circling high in the sky, alternately soaring and descending,\\r\\napproaching, and leaving one another, as if they were the embodiment of my own\\r\\nthoughts. Or I was attracted by the passage of wild pigeons from this wood to\\r\\nthat, with a slight quivering winnowing sound and carrier haste; or from under\\r\\na rotten stump my hoe turned up a sluggish portentous and outlandish spotted\\r\\nsalamander, a trace of Egypt and the Nile, yet our contemporary. When I paused\\r\\nto lean on my hoe, these sounds and sights I heard and saw anywhere in the row,\\r\\na part of the inexhaustible entertainment which the country offers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn gala days the town fires its great guns, which echo like popguns to these\\r\\nwoods, and some waifs of martial music occasionally penetrate thus far. To me,\\r\\naway there in my bean-field at the other end of the town, the big guns sounded\\r\\nas if a puffball had burst; and when there was a military turnout of which I\\r\\nwas ignorant, I have sometimes had a vague sense all the day of some sort of\\r\\nitching and disease in the horizon, as if some eruption would break out there\\r\\nsoon, either scarlatina or canker-rash, until at length some more favorable\\r\\npuff of wind, making haste over the fields and up the Wayland road, brought me\\r\\ninformation of the “trainers.” It seemed by the distant hum as if\\r\\nsomebody’s bees had swarmed, and that the neighbors, according to\\r\\nVirgil’s advice, by a faint tintinnabulum upon the most sonorous\\r\\nof their domestic utensils, were endeavoring to call them down into the hive\\r\\nagain. And when the sound died quite away, and the hum had ceased, and the most\\r\\nfavorable breezes told no tale, I knew that they had got the last drone of them\\r\\nall safely into the Middlesex hive, and that now their minds were bent on the\\r\\nhoney with which it was smeared.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI felt proud to know that the liberties of Massachusetts and of our fatherland\\r\\nwere in such safe keeping; and as I turned to my hoeing again I was filled with\\r\\nan inexpressible confidence, and pursued my labor cheerfully with a calm trust\\r\\nin the future.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen there were several bands of musicians, it sounded as if all the village\\r\\nwas a vast bellows, and all the buildings expanded and collapsed alternately\\r\\nwith a din. But sometimes it was a really noble and inspiring strain that\\r\\nreached these woods, and the trumpet that sings of fame, and I felt as if I\\r\\ncould spit a Mexican with a good relish,—for why should we always stand\\r\\nfor trifles?—and looked round for a woodchuck or a skunk to exercise my\\r\\nchivalry upon. These martial strains seemed as far away as Palestine, and\\r\\nreminded me of a march of crusaders in the horizon, with a slight tantivy and\\r\\ntremulous motion of the elm-tree tops which overhang the village. This was one\\r\\nof the great days; though the sky had from my clearing only the same\\r\\neverlastingly great look that it wears daily, and I saw no difference in it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a singular experience that long acquaintance which I cultivated with\\r\\nbeans, what with planting, and hoeing, and harvesting, and threshing, and\\r\\npicking over and selling them,—the last was the hardest of all,—I\\r\\nmight add eating, for I did taste. I was determined to know beans. When they\\r\\nwere growing, I used to hoe from five o’clock in the morning till noon,\\r\\nand commonly spent the rest of the day about other affairs. Consider the\\r\\nintimate and curious acquaintance one makes with various kinds of\\r\\nweeds,—it will bear some iteration in the account, for there was no\\r\\nlittle iteration in the labor,—disturbing their delicate organizations so\\r\\nruthlessly, and making such invidious distinctions with his hoe, levelling\\r\\nwhole ranks of one species, and sedulously cultivating another. That’s\\r\\nRoman wormwood,—that’s pigweed,—that’s\\r\\nsorrel,—that’s piper-grass,—have at him, chop him up, turn\\r\\nhis roots upward to the sun, don’t let him have a fibre in the shade, if\\r\\nyou do he’ll turn himself t’other side up and be as green as a leek\\r\\nin two days. A long war, not with cranes, but with weeds, those Trojans who had\\r\\nsun and rain and dews on their side. Daily the beans saw me come to their\\r\\nrescue armed with a hoe, and thin the ranks of their enemies, filling up the\\r\\ntrenches with weedy dead. Many a lusty crest-waving Hector, that towered a\\r\\nwhole foot above his crowding comrades, fell before my weapon and rolled in the\\r\\ndust.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThose summer days which some of my contemporaries devoted to the fine arts in\\r\\nBoston or Rome, and others to contemplation in India, and others to trade in\\r\\nLondon or New York, I thus, with the other farmers of New England, devoted to\\r\\nhusbandry. Not that I wanted beans to eat, for I am by nature a Pythagorean, so\\r\\nfar as beans are concerned, whether they mean porridge or voting, and exchanged\\r\\nthem for rice; but, perchance, as some must work in fields if only for the sake\\r\\nof tropes and expression, to serve a parable-maker one day. It was on the whole\\r\\na rare amusement, which, continued too long, might have become a dissipation.\\r\\nThough I gave them no manure, and did not hoe them all once, I hoed them\\r\\nunusually well as far as I went, and was paid for it in the end, “there\\r\\nbeing in truth,” as Evelyn says, “no compost or lÃ¦tation\\r\\nwhatsoever comparable to this continual motion, repastination, and turning of\\r\\nthe mould with the spade.” “The earth,” he adds elsewhere,\\r\\n“especially if fresh, has a certain magnetism in it, by which it attracts\\r\\nthe salt, power, or virtue (call it either) which gives it life, and is the\\r\\nlogic of all the labor and stir we keep about it, to sustain us; all dungings\\r\\nand other sordid temperings being but the vicars succedaneous to this\\r\\nimprovement.” Moreover, this being one of those “worn-out and\\r\\nexhausted lay fields which enjoy their sabbath,” had perchance, as Sir\\r\\nKenelm Digby thinks likely, attracted “vital spirits” from the air.\\r\\nI harvested twelve bushels of beans.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut to be more particular, for it is complained that Mr. Coleman has reported\\r\\nchiefly the expensive experiments of gentlemen farmers, my outgoes were,—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n    For a hoe,.................................. $ 0.54\\r\\n    Ploughing, harrowing, and furrowing,.........  7.50  Too much.\\r\\n    Beans for seed,..............................  3.12Â½\\r\\n    Potatoes for seed,...........................  1.33\\r\\n    Peas for seed,...............................  0.40\\r\\n    Turnip seed,.................................  0.06\\r\\n    White line for crow fence,...................  0.02\\r\\n    Horse cultivator and boy three hours,........  1.00\\r\\n    Horse and cart to get crop,..................  0.75\\r\\n                                                ————\\r\\n        In all,................................. $14.72Â½\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMy income was (patrem familias vendacem, non emacem esse oportet), from\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n    Nine bushels and twelve quarts of beans sold,. $16.94\\r\\n    Five    \"    large potatoes,.................... 2.50\\r\\n    Nine    \"    small,............................. 2.25\\r\\n    Grass,.......................................... 1.00\\r\\n    Stalks,......................................... 0.75\\r\\n                                                  ————\\r\\n        In all,................................... $23.44\\r\\n    Leaving a pecuniary profit,\\r\\n        as I have elsewhere said, of..............  $8.71Â½.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis is the result of my experience in raising beans. Plant the common small\\r\\nwhite bush bean about the first of June, in rows three feet by eighteen inches\\r\\napart, being careful to select fresh round and unmixed seed. First look out for\\r\\nworms, and supply vacancies by planting anew. Then look out for woodchucks, if\\r\\nit is an exposed place, for they will nibble off the earliest tender leaves\\r\\nalmost clean as they go; and again, when the young tendrils make their\\r\\nappearance, they have notice of it, and will shear them off with both buds and\\r\\nyoung pods, sitting erect like a squirrel. But above all harvest as early as\\r\\npossible, if you would escape frosts and have a fair and salable crop; you may\\r\\nsave much loss by this means.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis further experience also I gained. I said to myself, I will not plant beans\\r\\nand corn with so much industry another summer, but such seeds, if the seed is\\r\\nnot lost, as sincerity, truth, simplicity, faith, innocence, and the like, and\\r\\nsee if they will not grow in this soil, even with less toil and manurance, and\\r\\nsustain me, for surely it has not been exhausted for these crops. Alas! I said\\r\\nthis to myself; but now another summer is gone, and another, and another, and I\\r\\nam obliged to say to you, Reader, that the seeds which I planted, if indeed\\r\\nthey were the seeds of those virtues, were wormeaten or had lost their\\r\\nvitality, and so did not come up. Commonly men will only be brave as their\\r\\nfathers were brave, or timid. This generation is very sure to plant corn and\\r\\nbeans each new year precisely as the Indians did centuries ago and taught the\\r\\nfirst settlers to do, as if there were a fate in it. I saw an old man the other\\r\\nday, to my astonishment, making the holes with a hoe for the seventieth time at\\r\\nleast, and not for himself to lie down in! But why should not the New Englander\\r\\ntry new adventures, and not lay so much stress on his grain, his potato and\\r\\ngrass crop, and his orchards,—raise other crops than these? Why concern\\r\\nourselves so much about our beans for seed, and not be concerned at all about a\\r\\nnew generation of men? We should really be fed and cheered if when we met a man\\r\\nwe were sure to see that some of the qualities which I have named, which we all\\r\\nprize more than those other productions, but which are for the most part\\r\\nbroadcast and floating in the air, had taken root and grown in him. Here comes\\r\\nsuch a subtile and ineffable quality, for instance, as truth or justice, though\\r\\nthe slightest amount or new variety of it, along the road. Our ambassadors\\r\\nshould be instructed to send home such seeds as these, and Congress help to\\r\\ndistribute them over all the land. We should never stand upon ceremony with\\r\\nsincerity. We should never cheat and insult and banish one another by our\\r\\nmeanness, if there were present the kernel of worth and friendliness. We should\\r\\nnot meet thus in haste. Most men I do not meet at all, for they seem not to\\r\\nhave time; they are busy about their beans. We would not deal with a man thus\\r\\nplodding ever, leaning on a hoe or a spade as a staff between his work, not as\\r\\na mushroom, but partially risen out of the earth, something more than erect,\\r\\nlike swallows alighted and walking on the ground:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And as he spake, his wings would now and then\\r\\nSpread, as he meant to fly, then close again,”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nso that we should suspect that we might be conversing with an angel. Bread may\\r\\nnot always nourish us; but it always does us good, it even takes stiffness out\\r\\nof our joints, and makes us supple and buoyant, when we knew not what ailed us,\\r\\nto recognize any generosity in man or Nature, to share any unmixed and heroic\\r\\njoy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAncient poetry and mythology suggest, at least, that husbandry was once a\\r\\nsacred art; but it is pursued with irreverent haste and heedlessness by us, our\\r\\nobject being to have large farms and large crops merely. We have no festival,\\r\\nnor procession, nor ceremony, not excepting our Cattle-shows and so called\\r\\nThanksgivings, by which the farmer expresses a sense of the sacredness of his\\r\\ncalling, or is reminded of its sacred origin. It is the premium and the feast\\r\\nwhich tempt him. He sacrifices not to Ceres and the Terrestrial Jove, but to\\r\\nthe infernal Plutus rather. By avarice and selfishness, and a grovelling habit,\\r\\nfrom which none of us is free, of regarding the soil as property, or the means\\r\\nof acquiring property chiefly, the landscape is deformed, husbandry is degraded\\r\\nwith us, and the farmer leads the meanest of lives. He knows Nature but as a\\r\\nrobber. Cato says that the profits of agriculture are particularly pious or\\r\\njust, (maximeque pius quÃ¦stus), and according to Varro the old Romans\\r\\n“called the same earth Mother and Ceres, and thought that they who\\r\\ncultivated it led a pious and useful life, and that they alone were left of the\\r\\nrace of King Saturn.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe are wont to forget that the sun looks on our cultivated fields and on the\\r\\nprairies and forests without distinction. They all reflect and absorb his rays\\r\\nalike, and the former make but a small part of the glorious picture which he\\r\\nbeholds in his daily course. In his view the earth is all equally cultivated\\r\\nlike a garden. Therefore we should receive the benefit of his light and heat\\r\\nwith a corresponding trust and magnanimity. What though I value the seed of\\r\\nthese beans, and harvest that in the fall of the year? This broad field which I\\r\\nhave looked at so long looks not to me as the principal cultivator, but away\\r\\nfrom me to influences more genial to it, which water and make it green. These\\r\\nbeans have results which are not harvested by me. Do they not grow for\\r\\nwoodchucks partly? The ear of wheat (in Latin spica, obsoletely\\r\\nspeca, from spe, hope) should not be the only hope of the\\r\\nhusbandman; its kernel or grain (granum from gerendo, bearing) is\\r\\nnot all that it bears. How, then, can our harvest fail? Shall I not rejoice\\r\\nalso at the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granary of the birds? It\\r\\nmatters little comparatively whether the fields fill the farmer’s barns.\\r\\nThe true husbandman will cease from anxiety, as the squirrels manifest no\\r\\nconcern whether the woods will bear chestnuts this year or not, and finish his\\r\\nlabor with every day, relinquishing all claim to the produce of his fields, and\\r\\nsacrificing in his mind not only his first but his last fruits also.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The Village\\n\\r\\nAfter hoeing, or perhaps reading and writing, in the forenoon, I usually bathed\\r\\nagain in the pond, swimming across one of its coves for a stint, and washed the\\r\\ndust of labor from my person, or smoothed out the last wrinkle which study had\\r\\nmade, and for the afternoon was absolutely free. Every day or two I strolled to\\r\\nthe village to hear some of the gossip which is incessantly going on there,\\r\\ncirculating either from mouth to mouth, or from newspaper to newspaper, and\\r\\nwhich, taken in homÅ\\x93opathic doses, was really as refreshing in its way as the\\r\\nrustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs. As I walked in the woods to see the\\r\\nbirds and squirrels, so I walked in the village to see the men and boys;\\r\\ninstead of the wind among the pines I heard the carts rattle. In one direction\\r\\nfrom my house there was a colony of muskrats in the river meadows; under the\\r\\ngrove of elms and buttonwoods in the other horizon was a village of busy men,\\r\\nas curious to me as if they had been prairie dogs, each sitting at the mouth of\\r\\nits burrow, or running over to a neighbor’s to gossip. I went there\\r\\nfrequently to observe their habits. The village appeared to me a great news\\r\\nroom; and on one side, to support it, as once at Redding & Company’s\\r\\non State Street, they kept nuts and raisins, or salt and meal and other\\r\\ngroceries. Some have such a vast appetite for the former commodity, that is,\\r\\nthe news, and such sound digestive organs, that they can sit forever in public\\r\\navenues without stirring, and let it simmer and whisper through them like the\\r\\nEtesian winds, or as if inhaling ether, it only producing numbness and\\r\\ninsensibility to pain,—otherwise it would often be painful to\\r\\nhear,—without affecting the consciousness. I hardly ever failed, when I\\r\\nrambled through the village, to see a row of such worthies, either sitting on a\\r\\nladder sunning themselves, with their bodies inclined forward and their eyes\\r\\nglancing along the line this way and that, from time to time, with a voluptuous\\r\\nexpression, or else leaning against a barn with their hands in their pockets,\\r\\nlike caryatides, as if to prop it up. They, being commonly out of doors, heard\\r\\nwhatever was in the wind. These are the coarsest mills, in which all gossip is\\r\\nfirst rudely digested or cracked up before it is emptied into finer and more\\r\\ndelicate hoppers within doors. I observed that the vitals of the village were\\r\\nthe grocery, the bar-room, the post-office, and the bank; and, as a necessary\\r\\npart of the machinery, they kept a bell, a big gun, and a fire-engine, at\\r\\nconvenient places; and the houses were so arranged as to make the most of\\r\\nmankind, in lanes and fronting one another, so that every traveller had to run\\r\\nthe gantlet, and every man, woman, and child might get a lick at him. Of\\r\\ncourse, those who were stationed nearest to the head of the line, where they\\r\\ncould most see and be seen, and have the first blow at him, paid the highest\\r\\nprices for their places; and the few straggling inhabitants in the outskirts,\\r\\nwhere long gaps in the line began to occur, and the traveller could get over\\r\\nwalls or turn aside into cow paths, and so escape, paid a very slight ground or\\r\\nwindow tax. Signs were hung out on all sides to allure him; some to catch him\\r\\nby the appetite, as the tavern and victualling cellar; some by the fancy, as\\r\\nthe dry goods store and the jeweller’s; and others by the hair or the\\r\\nfeet or the skirts, as the barber, the shoemaker, or the tailor. Besides, there\\r\\nwas a still more terrible standing invitation to call at every one of these\\r\\nhouses, and company expected about these times. For the most part I escaped\\r\\nwonderfully from these dangers, either by proceeding at once boldly and without\\r\\ndeliberation to the goal, as is recommended to those who run the gantlet, or by\\r\\nkeeping my thoughts on high things, like Orpheus, who, “loudly singing\\r\\nthe praises of the gods to his lyre, drowned the voices of the Sirens, and kept\\r\\nout of danger.” Sometimes I bolted suddenly, and nobody could tell my\\r\\nwhereabouts, for I did not stand much about gracefulness, and never hesitated\\r\\nat a gap in a fence. I was even accustomed to make an irruption into some\\r\\nhouses, where I was well entertained, and after learning the kernels and very\\r\\nlast sieve-ful of news, what had subsided, the prospects of war and peace, and\\r\\nwhether the world was likely to hold together much longer, I was let out\\r\\nthrough the rear avenues, and so escaped to the woods again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was very pleasant, when I stayed late in town, to launch myself into the\\r\\nnight, especially if it was dark and tempestuous, and set sail from some bright\\r\\nvillage parlor or lecture room, with a bag of rye or Indian meal upon my\\r\\nshoulder, for my snug harbor in the woods, having made all tight without and\\r\\nwithdrawn under hatches with a merry crew of thoughts, leaving only my outer\\r\\nman at the helm, or even tying up the helm when it was plain sailing. I had\\r\\nmany a genial thought by the cabin fire “as I sailed.” I was never\\r\\ncast away nor distressed in any weather, though I encountered some severe\\r\\nstorms. It is darker in the woods, even in common nights, than most suppose. I\\r\\nfrequently had to look up at the opening between the trees above the path in\\r\\norder to learn my route, and, where there was no cart-path, to feel with my\\r\\nfeet the faint track which I had worn, or steer by the known relation of\\r\\nparticular trees which I felt with my hands, passing between two pines for\\r\\ninstance, not more than eighteen inches apart, in the midst of the woods,\\r\\ninvariably, in the darkest night. Sometimes, after coming home thus late in a\\r\\ndark and muggy night, when my feet felt the path which my eyes could not see,\\r\\ndreaming and absent-minded all the way, until I was aroused by having to raise\\r\\nmy hand to lift the latch, I have not been able to recall a single step of my\\r\\nwalk, and I have thought that perhaps my body would find its way home if its\\r\\nmaster should forsake it, as the hand finds its way to the mouth without\\r\\nassistance. Several times, when a visitor chanced to stay into evening, and it\\r\\nproved a dark night, I was obliged to conduct him to the cart-path in the rear\\r\\nof the house, and then point out to him the direction he was to pursue, and in\\r\\nkeeping which he was to be guided rather by his feet than his eyes. One very\\r\\ndark night I directed thus on their way two young men who had been fishing in\\r\\nthe pond. They lived about a mile off through the woods, and were quite used to\\r\\nthe route. A day or two after one of them told me that they wandered about the\\r\\ngreater part of the night, close by their own premises, and did not get home\\r\\ntill toward morning, by which time, as there had been several heavy showers in\\r\\nthe mean while, and the leaves were very wet, they were drenched to their skins.\\r\\nI have heard of many going astray even in the village streets, when the\\r\\ndarkness was so thick that you could cut it with a knife, as the saying is.\\r\\nSome who live in the outskirts, having come to town a-shopping in their wagons,\\r\\nhave been obliged to put up for the night; and gentlemen and ladies making a\\r\\ncall have gone half a mile out of their way, feeling the sidewalk only with\\r\\ntheir feet, and not knowing when they turned. It is a surprising and memorable,\\r\\nas well as valuable experience, to be lost in the woods any time. Often in a\\r\\nsnow storm, even by day, one will come out upon a well-known road and yet find\\r\\nit impossible to tell which way leads to the village. Though he knows that he\\r\\nhas travelled it a thousand times, he cannot recognize a feature in it, but it\\r\\nis as strange to him as if it were a road in Siberia. By night, of course, the\\r\\nperplexity is infinitely greater. In our most trivial walks, we are constantly,\\r\\nthough unconsciously, steering like pilots by certain well-known beacons and\\r\\nheadlands, and if we go beyond our usual course we still carry in our minds the\\r\\nbearing of some neighboring cape; and not till we are completely lost, or\\r\\nturned round,—for a man needs only to be turned round once with his eyes\\r\\nshut in this world to be lost,—do we appreciate the vastness and\\r\\nstrangeness of Nature. Every man has to learn the points of compass again as\\r\\noften as he awakes, whether from sleep or any abstraction. Not till we are\\r\\nlost, in other words not till we have lost the world, do we begin to find\\r\\nourselves, and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne afternoon, near the end of the first summer, when I went to the village to\\r\\nget a shoe from the cobbler’s, I was seized and put into jail, because,\\r\\nas I have elsewhere related, I did not pay a tax to, or recognize the authority\\r\\nof, the state which buys and sells men, women, and children, like cattle at\\r\\nthe door of its senate-house. I had gone down to the woods for other purposes.\\r\\nBut, wherever a man goes, men will pursue and paw him with their dirty\\r\\ninstitutions, and, if they can, constrain him to belong to their desperate\\r\\nodd-fellow society. It is true, I might have resisted forcibly with more or\\r\\nless effect, might have run “amok” against society; but I preferred\\r\\nthat society should run “amok” against me, it being the desperate\\r\\nparty. However, I was released the next day, obtained my mended shoe, and\\r\\nreturned to the woods in season to get my dinner of huckleberries on Fair-Haven\\r\\nHill. I was never molested by any person but those who represented the state. I\\r\\nhad no lock nor bolt but for the desk which held my papers, not even a nail to\\r\\nput over my latch or windows. I never fastened my door night or day, though I\\r\\nwas to be absent several days; not even when the next fall I spent a fortnight\\r\\nin the woods of Maine. And yet my house was more respected than if it had been\\r\\nsurrounded by a file of soldiers. The tired rambler could rest and warm himself\\r\\nby my fire, the literary amuse himself with the few books on my table, or the\\r\\ncurious, by opening my closet door, see what was left of my dinner, and what\\r\\nprospect I had of a supper. Yet, though many people of every class came this\\r\\nway to the pond, I suffered no serious inconvenience from these sources, and I\\r\\nnever missed anything but one small book, a volume of Homer, which perhaps was\\r\\nimproperly gilded, and this I trust a soldier of our camp has found by this\\r\\ntime. I am convinced, that if all men were to live as simply as I then did,\\r\\nthieving and robbery would be unknown. These take place only in communities\\r\\nwhere some have got more than is sufficient while others have not enough. The\\r\\nPope’s Homers would soon get properly distributed.—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0“Nec bella fuerunt,\\r\\nFaginus astabat dum scyphus ante dapes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0“Nor wars did men molest,\\r\\nWhen only beechen bowls were in request.”\\n\\n\\r\\n“You who govern public affairs, what need have you to employ punishments?\\r\\nLove virtue, and the people will be virtuous. The virtues of a superior man are\\r\\nlike the wind; the virtues of a common man are like the grass; the grass, when\\r\\nthe wind passes over it, bends.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The Ponds\\n\\r\\nSometimes, having had a surfeit of human society and gossip, and worn out all\\r\\nmy village friends, I rambled still farther westward than I habitually dwell,\\r\\ninto yet more unfrequented parts of the town, “to fresh woods and\\r\\npastures new,” or, while the sun was setting, made my supper of\\r\\nhuckleberries and blueberries on Fair Haven Hill, and laid up a store for\\r\\nseveral days. The fruits do not yield their true flavor to the purchaser of\\r\\nthem, nor to him who raises them for the market. There is but one way to obtain\\r\\nit, yet few take that way. If you would know the flavor of huckleberries, ask\\r\\nthe cow-boy or the partridge. It is a vulgar error to suppose that you have\\r\\ntasted huckleberries who never plucked them. A huckleberry never reaches\\r\\nBoston; they have not been known there since they grew on her three hills. The\\r\\nambrosial and essential part of the fruit is lost with the bloom which is\\r\\nrubbed off in the market cart, and they become mere provender. As long as\\r\\nEternal Justice reigns, not one innocent huckleberry can be transported thither\\r\\nfrom the country’s hills.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOccasionally, after my hoeing was done for the day, I joined some impatient\\r\\ncompanion who had been fishing on the pond since morning, as silent and\\r\\nmotionless as a duck or a floating leaf, and, after practising various kinds of\\r\\nphilosophy, had concluded commonly, by the time I arrived, that he belonged to\\r\\nthe ancient sect of CÅ\\x93nobites. There was one older man, an excellent\\r\\nfisher and skilled in all kinds of woodcraft, who was pleased to look upon my\\r\\nhouse as a building erected for the convenience of fishermen; and I was equally\\r\\npleased when he sat in my doorway to arrange his lines. Once in a while we sat\\r\\ntogether on the pond, he at one end of the boat, and I at the other; but not\\r\\nmany words passed between us, for he had grown deaf in his later years, but he\\r\\noccasionally hummed a psalm, which harmonized well enough with my philosophy.\\r\\nOur intercourse was thus altogether one of unbroken harmony, far more pleasing\\r\\nto remember than if it had been carried on by speech. When, as was commonly the\\r\\ncase, I had none to commune with, I used to raise the echoes by striking with a\\r\\npaddle on the side of my boat, filling the surrounding woods with circling and\\r\\ndilating sound, stirring them up as the keeper of a menagerie his wild beasts,\\r\\nuntil I elicited a growl from every wooded vale and hill-side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn warm evenings I frequently sat in the boat playing the flute, and saw the\\r\\nperch, which I seemed to have charmed, hovering around me, and the moon\\r\\ntravelling over the ribbed bottom, which was strewed with the wrecks of the\\r\\nforest. Formerly I had come to this pond adventurously, from time to time, in\\r\\ndark summer nights, with a companion, and making a fire close to the\\r\\nwater’s edge, which we thought attracted the fishes, we caught pouts with\\r\\na bunch of worms strung on a thread; and when we had done, far in the night,\\r\\nthrew the burning brands high into the air like skyrockets, which, coming down\\r\\ninto the pond, were quenched with a loud hissing, and we were suddenly groping\\r\\nin total darkness. Through this, whistling a tune, we took our way to the\\r\\nhaunts of men again. But now I had made my home by the shore.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSometimes, after staying in a village parlor till the family had all retired, I\\r\\nhave returned to the woods, and, partly with a view to the next day’s\\r\\ndinner, spent the hours of midnight fishing from a boat by moonlight, serenaded\\r\\nby owls and foxes, and hearing, from time to time, the creaking note of some\\r\\nunknown bird close at hand. These experiences were very memorable and valuable\\r\\nto me,—anchored in forty feet of water, and twenty or thirty rods from the\\r\\nshore, surrounded sometimes by thousands of small perch and shiners, dimpling\\r\\nthe surface with their tails in the moonlight, and communicating by a long\\r\\nflaxen line with mysterious nocturnal fishes which had their dwelling forty\\r\\nfeet below, or sometimes dragging sixty feet of line about the pond as I\\r\\ndrifted in the gentle night breeze, now and then feeling a slight vibration\\r\\nalong it, indicative of some life prowling about its extremity, of dull\\r\\nuncertain blundering purpose there, and slow to make up its mind. At length you\\r\\nslowly raise, pulling hand over hand, some horned pout squeaking and squirming\\r\\nto the upper air. It was very queer, especially in dark nights, when your\\r\\nthoughts had wandered to vast and cosmogonal themes in other spheres, to feel\\r\\nthis faint jerk, which came to interrupt your dreams and link you to Nature\\r\\nagain. It seemed as if I might next cast my line upward into the air, as well\\r\\nas downward into this element, which was scarcely more dense. Thus I caught two\\r\\nfishes as it were with one hook.\\n\\n\\r\\nThe scenery of Walden is on a humble scale, and, though very beautiful, does\\r\\nnot approach to grandeur, nor can it much concern one who has not long\\r\\nfrequented it or lived by its shore; yet this pond is so remarkable for its\\r\\ndepth and purity as to merit a particular description. It is a clear and deep\\r\\ngreen well, half a mile long and a mile and three quarters in circumference,\\r\\nand contains about sixty-one and a half acres; a perennial spring in the midst\\r\\nof pine and oak woods, without any visible inlet or outlet except by the clouds\\r\\nand evaporation. The surrounding hills rise abruptly from the water to the\\r\\nheight of forty to eighty feet, though on the south-east and east they attain to\\r\\nabout one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet respectively, within a quarter\\r\\nand a third of a mile. They are exclusively woodland. All our Concord waters\\r\\nhave two colors at least; one when viewed at a distance, and another, more\\r\\nproper, close at hand. The first depends more on the light, and follows the\\r\\nsky. In clear weather, in summer, they appear blue at a little distance,\\r\\nespecially if agitated, and at a great distance all appear alike. In stormy\\r\\nweather they are sometimes of a dark slate color. The sea, however, is said to\\r\\nbe blue one day and green another without any perceptible change in the\\r\\natmosphere. I have seen our river, when, the landscape being covered with snow,\\r\\nboth water and ice were almost as green as grass. Some consider blue “to\\r\\nbe the color of pure water, whether liquid or solid.” But, looking\\r\\ndirectly down into our waters from a boat, they are seen to be of very\\r\\ndifferent colors. Walden is blue at one time and green at another, even from\\r\\nthe same point of view. Lying between the earth and the heavens, it partakes of\\r\\nthe color of both. Viewed from a hill-top it reflects the color of the sky; but\\r\\nnear at hand it is of a yellowish tint next the shore where you can see the\\r\\nsand, then a light green, which gradually deepens to a uniform dark green in\\r\\nthe body of the pond. In some lights, viewed even from a hill-top, it is of a\\r\\nvivid green next the shore. Some have referred this to the reflection of the\\r\\nverdure; but it is equally green there against the railroad sand-bank, and in\\r\\nthe spring, before the leaves are expanded, and it may be simply the result of\\r\\nthe prevailing blue mixed with the yellow of the sand. Such is the color of its\\r\\niris. This is that portion, also, where in the spring, the ice being warmed by\\r\\nthe heat of the sun reflected from the bottom, and also transmitted through the\\r\\nearth, melts first and forms a narrow canal about the still frozen middle. Like\\r\\nthe rest of our waters, when much agitated, in clear weather, so that the\\r\\nsurface of the waves may reflect the sky at the right angle, or because there\\r\\nis more light mixed with it, it appears at a little distance of a darker blue\\r\\nthan the sky itself; and at such a time, being on its surface, and looking with\\r\\ndivided vision, so as to see the reflection, I have discerned a matchless and\\r\\nindescribable light blue, such as watered or changeable silks and sword blades\\r\\nsuggest, more cerulean than the sky itself, alternating with the original dark\\r\\ngreen on the opposite sides of the waves, which last appeared but muddy in\\r\\ncomparison. It is a vitreous greenish blue, as I remember it, like those\\r\\npatches of the winter sky seen through cloud vistas in the west before sundown.\\r\\nYet a single glass of its water held up to the light is as colorless as an\\r\\nequal quantity of air. It is well known that a large plate of glass will have a\\r\\ngreen tint, owing, as the makers say, to its “body,” but a small\\r\\npiece of the same will be colorless. How large a body of Walden water would be\\r\\nrequired to reflect a green tint I have never proved. The water of our river is\\r\\nblack or a very dark brown to one looking directly down on it, and, like that\\r\\nof most ponds, imparts to the body of one bathing in it a yellowish tinge; but\\r\\nthis water is of such crystalline purity that the body of the bather appears of\\r\\nan alabaster whiteness, still more unnatural, which, as the limbs are magnified\\r\\nand distorted withal, produces a monstrous effect, making fit studies for a\\r\\nMichael Angelo.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned at the\\r\\ndepth of twenty-five or thirty feet. Paddling over it, you may see, many feet\\r\\nbeneath the surface the schools of perch and shiners, perhaps only an inch\\r\\nlong, yet the former easily distinguished by their transverse bars, and you\\r\\nthink that they must be ascetic fish that find a subsistence there. Once, in\\r\\nthe winter, many years ago, when I had been cutting holes through the ice in\\r\\norder to catch pickerel, as I stepped ashore I tossed my axe back on to the\\r\\nice, but, as if some evil genius had directed it, it slid four or five rods\\r\\ndirectly into one of the holes, where the water was twenty-five feet deep. Out\\r\\nof curiosity, I lay down on the ice and looked through the hole, until I saw\\r\\nthe axe a little on one side, standing on its head, with its helve erect and\\r\\ngently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond; and there it might have\\r\\nstood erect and swaying till in the course of time the handle rotted off, if I\\r\\nhad not disturbed it. Making another hole directly over it with an ice chisel\\r\\nwhich I had, and cutting down the longest birch which I could find in the\\r\\nneighborhood with my knife, I made a slip-noose, which I attached to its end,\\r\\nand, letting it down carefully, passed it over the knob of the handle, and drew\\r\\nit by a line along the birch, and so pulled the axe out again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like paving\\r\\nstones, excepting one or two short sand beaches, and is so steep that in many\\r\\nplaces a single leap will carry you into water over your head; and were it not\\r\\nfor its remarkable transparency, that would be the last to be seen of its\\r\\nbottom till it rose on the opposite side. Some think it is bottomless. It is\\r\\nnowhere muddy, and a casual observer would say that there were no weeds at all\\r\\nin it; and of noticeable plants, except in the little meadows recently\\r\\noverflowed, which do not properly belong to it, a closer scrutiny does not\\r\\ndetect a flag nor a bulrush, nor even a lily, yellow or white, but only a few\\r\\nsmall heart-leaves and potamogetons, and perhaps a water-target or two; all\\r\\nwhich however a bather might not perceive; and these plants are clean and\\r\\nbright like the element they grow in. The stones extend a rod or two into the\\r\\nwater, and then the bottom is pure sand, except in the deepest parts, where\\r\\nthere is usually a little sediment, probably from the decay of the leaves which\\r\\nhave been wafted on to it so many successive falls, and a bright green weed is\\r\\nbrought up on anchors even in midwinter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe have one other pond just like this, White Pond, in Nine Acre Corner, about\\r\\ntwo and a half miles westerly; but, though I am acquainted with most of the\\r\\nponds within a dozen miles of this centre I do not know a third of this pure\\r\\nand well-like character. Successive nations perchance have drank at, admired,\\r\\nand fathomed it, and passed away, and still its water is green and pellucid as\\r\\never. Not an intermitting spring! Perhaps on that spring morning when Adam and\\r\\nEve were driven out of Eden Walden Pond was already in existence, and even then\\r\\nbreaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied with mist and a southerly wind,\\r\\nand covered with myriads of ducks and geese, which had not heard of the fall,\\r\\nwhen still such pure lakes sufficed them. Even then it had commenced to rise\\r\\nand fall, and had clarified its waters and colored them of the hue they now\\r\\nwear, and obtained a patent of heaven to be the only Walden Pond in the world\\r\\nand distiller of celestial dews. Who knows in how many unremembered\\r\\nnations’ literatures this has been the Castalian Fountain? or what nymphs\\r\\npresided over it in the Golden Age? It is a gem of the first water which\\r\\nConcord wears in her coronet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYet perchance the first who came to this well have left some trace of their\\r\\nfootsteps. I have been surprised to detect encircling the pond, even where a\\r\\nthick wood has just been cut down on the shore, a narrow shelf-like path in the\\r\\nsteep hill-side, alternately rising and falling, approaching and receding from\\r\\nthe water’s edge, as old probably as the race of man here, worn by the\\r\\nfeet of aboriginal hunters, and still from time to time unwittingly trodden by\\r\\nthe present occupants of the land. This is particularly distinct to one\\r\\nstanding on the middle of the pond in winter, just after a light snow has\\r\\nfallen, appearing as a clear undulating white line, unobscured by weeds and\\r\\ntwigs, and very obvious a quarter of a mile off in many places where in summer\\r\\nit is hardly distinguishable close at hand. The snow reprints it, as it were,\\r\\nin clear white type alto-relievo. The ornamented grounds of villas which will\\r\\none day be built here may still preserve some trace of this.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe pond rises and falls, but whether regularly or not, and within what period,\\r\\nnobody knows, though, as usual, many pretend to know. It is commonly higher in\\r\\nthe winter and lower in the summer, though not corresponding to the general wet\\r\\nand dryness. I can remember when it was a foot or two lower, and also when it\\r\\nwas at least five feet higher, than when I lived by it. There is a narrow\\r\\nsand-bar running into it, with very deep water on one side, on which I helped\\r\\nboil a kettle of chowder, some six rods from the main shore, about the year\\r\\n1824, which it has not been possible to do for twenty-five years; and on the\\r\\nother hand, my friends used to listen with incredulity when I told them, that a\\r\\nfew years later I was accustomed to fish from a boat in a secluded cove in the\\r\\nwoods, fifteen rods from the only shore they knew, which place was long since\\r\\nconverted into a meadow. But the pond has risen steadily for two years, and\\r\\nnow, in the summer of ’52, is just five feet higher than when I lived\\r\\nthere, or as high as it was thirty years ago, and fishing goes on again in the\\r\\nmeadow. This makes a difference of level, at the outside, of six or seven feet;\\r\\nand yet the water shed by the surrounding hills is insignificant in amount, and\\r\\nthis overflow must be referred to causes which affect the deep springs. This\\r\\nsame summer the pond has begun to fall again. It is remarkable that this\\r\\nfluctuation, whether periodical or not, appears thus to require many years for\\r\\nits accomplishment. I have observed one rise and a part of two falls, and I\\r\\nexpect that a dozen or fifteen years hence the water will again be as low as I\\r\\nhave ever known it. Flint’s Pond, a mile eastward, allowing for the\\r\\ndisturbance occasioned by its inlets and outlets, and the smaller intermediate\\r\\nponds also, sympathize with Walden, and recently attained their greatest height\\r\\nat the same time with the latter. The same is true, as far as my observation\\r\\ngoes, of White Pond.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis rise and fall of Walden at long intervals serves this use at least; the\\r\\nwater standing at this great height for a year or more, though it makes it\\r\\ndifficult to walk round it, kills the shrubs and trees which have sprung up\\r\\nabout its edge since the last rise, pitch-pines, birches, alders, aspens, and\\r\\nothers, and, falling again, leaves an unobstructed shore; for, unlike many\\r\\nponds and all waters which are subject to a daily tide, its shore is cleanest\\r\\nwhen the water is lowest. On the side of the pond next my house, a row of pitch\\r\\npines fifteen feet high has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever, and\\r\\nthus a stop put to their encroachments; and their size indicates how many years\\r\\nhave elapsed since the last rise to this height. By this fluctuation the pond\\r\\nasserts its title to a shore, and thus the shore is shorn, and\\r\\nthe trees cannot hold it by right of possession. These are the lips of the\\r\\nlake on which no beard grows. It licks its chaps from time to time. When the\\r\\nwater is at its height, the alders, willows, and maples send forth a mass of\\r\\nfibrous red roots several feet long from all sides of their stems in the water,\\r\\nand to the height of three or four feet from the ground, in the effort to\\r\\nmaintain themselves; and I have known the high-blueberry bushes about the\\r\\nshore, which commonly produce no fruit, bear an abundant crop under these\\r\\ncircumstances.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSome have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved. My\\r\\ntownsmen have all heard the tradition, the oldest people tell me that they\\r\\nheard it in their youth, that anciently the Indians were holding a pow-wow upon\\r\\na hill here, which rose as high into the heavens as the pond now sinks deep\\r\\ninto the earth, and they used much profanity, as the story goes, though this\\r\\nvice is one of which the Indians were never guilty, and while they were thus\\r\\nengaged the hill shook and suddenly sank, and only one old squaw, named Walden,\\r\\nescaped, and from her the pond was named. It has been conjectured that when the\\r\\nhill shook these stones rolled down its side and became the present shore. It\\r\\nis very certain, at any rate, that once there was no pond here, and now there\\r\\nis one; and this Indian fable does not in any respect conflict with the account\\r\\nof that ancient settler whom I have mentioned, who remembers so well when he\\r\\nfirst came here with his divining rod, saw a thin vapor rising from the sward,\\r\\nand the hazel pointed steadily downward, and he concluded to dig a well here.\\r\\nAs for the stones, many still think that they are hardly to be accounted for by\\r\\nthe action of the waves on these hills; but I observe that the surrounding\\r\\nhills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones, so that they have been\\r\\nobliged to pile them up in walls on both sides of the railroad cut nearest the\\r\\npond; and, moreover, there are most stones where the shore is most abrupt; so\\r\\nthat, unfortunately, it is no longer a mystery to me. I detect the paver. If\\r\\nthe name was not derived from that of some English locality,—Saffron\\r\\nWalden, for instance,—one might suppose that it was called originally\\r\\nWalled-in Pond.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe pond was my well ready dug. For four months in the year its water is as\\r\\ncold as it is pure at all times; and I think that it is then as good as any, if\\r\\nnot the best, in the town. In the winter, all water which is exposed to the air\\r\\nis colder than springs and wells which are protected from it. The temperature\\r\\nof the pond water which had stood in the room where I sat from five\\r\\no’clock in the afternoon till noon the next day, the sixth of March,\\r\\n1846, the thermometer having been up to 65° or 70° some of the time,\\r\\nowing partly to the sun on the roof, was 42°, or one degree colder than the\\r\\nwater of one of the coldest wells in the village just drawn. The temperature of\\r\\nthe Boiling Spring the same day was 45°, or the warmest of any water tried,\\r\\nthough it is the coldest that I know of in summer, when, beside, shallow and\\r\\nstagnant surface water is not mingled with it. Moreover, in summer, Walden\\r\\nnever becomes so warm as most water which is exposed to the sun, on account of\\r\\nits depth. In the warmest weather I usually placed a pailful in my cellar,\\r\\nwhere it became cool in the night, and remained so during the day; though I\\r\\nalso resorted to a spring in the neighborhood. It was as good when a week old\\r\\nas the day it was dipped, and had no taste of the pump. Whoever camps for a\\r\\nweek in summer by the shore of a pond, needs only bury a pail of water a few\\r\\nfeet deep in the shade of his camp to be independent of the luxury of ice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere have been caught in Walden pickerel, one weighing seven pounds, to\\r\\nsay nothing of another which carried off a reel with great velocity, which the\\r\\nfisherman safely set down at eight pounds because he did not see\\r\\nhim, perch and pouts, some of each weighing over two pounds, shiners,\\r\\nchivins or roach (Leuciscus pulchellus), a very few breams, and a couple\\r\\nof eels, one weighing four pounds,—I am thus particular because the weight\\r\\nof a fish is commonly its only title to fame, and these are the only eels I\\r\\nhave heard of here;—also, I have a faint recollection of a little fish\\r\\nsome five inches long, with silvery sides and a greenish back, somewhat\\r\\ndace-like in its character, which I mention here chiefly to link my facts to\\r\\nfable. Nevertheless, this pond is not very fertile in fish. Its pickerel,\\r\\nthough not abundant, are its chief boast. I have seen at one time lying on the\\r\\nice pickerel of at least three different kinds; a long and shallow one,\\r\\nsteel-colored, most like those caught in the river; a bright golden kind, with\\r\\ngreenish reflections and remarkably deep, which is the most common here; and\\r\\nanother, golden-colored, and shaped like the last, but peppered on the sides\\r\\nwith small dark brown or black spots, intermixed with a few faint blood-red\\r\\nones, very much like a trout. The specific name reticulatus would not\\r\\napply to this; it should be guttatus rather. These are all very firm\\r\\nfish, and weigh more than their size promises. The shiners, pouts, and perch\\r\\nalso, and indeed all the fishes which inhabit this pond, are much cleaner,\\r\\nhandsomer, and firmer fleshed than those in the river and most other ponds, as\\r\\nthe water is purer, and they can easily be distinguished from them. Probably\\r\\nmany ichthyologists would make new varieties of some of them. There are also a\\r\\nclean race of frogs and tortoises, and a few muscels in it; muskrats and minks\\r\\nleave their traces about it, and occasionally a travelling mud-turtle visits\\r\\nit. Sometimes, when I pushed off my boat in the morning, I disturbed a great\\r\\nmud-turtle which had secreted himself under the boat in the night. Ducks and\\r\\ngeese frequent it in the spring and fall, the white-bellied swallows\\r\\n(Hirundo bicolor) skim over it, and the peetweets (Totanus\\r\\nmacularius) “teter” along its stony shores all summer. I have\\r\\nsometimes disturbed a fishhawk sitting on a white-pine over the water; but I\\r\\ndoubt if it is ever profaned by the wing of a gull, like Fair Haven. At most,\\r\\nit tolerates one annual loon. These are all the animals of consequence which\\r\\nfrequent it now.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYou may see from a boat, in calm weather, near the sandy eastern shore, where\\r\\nthe water is eight or ten feet deep, and also in some other parts of the pond,\\r\\nsome circular heaps half a dozen feet in diameter by a foot in height,\\r\\nconsisting of small stones less than a hen’s egg in size, where all\\r\\naround is bare sand. At first you wonder if the Indians could have formed them\\r\\non the ice for any purpose, and so, when the ice melted, they sank to the\\r\\nbottom; but they are too regular and some of them plainly too fresh for that.\\r\\nThey are similar to those found in rivers; but as there are no suckers nor\\r\\nlampreys here, I know not by what fish they could be made. Perhaps they are the\\r\\nnests of the chivin. These lend a pleasing mystery to the bottom.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe shore is irregular enough not to be monotonous. I have in my mind’s\\r\\neye the western indented with deep bays, the bolder northern, and the\\r\\nbeautifully scalloped southern shore, where successive capes overlap each other\\r\\nand suggest unexplored coves between. The forest has never so good a setting,\\r\\nnor is so distinctly beautiful, as when seen from the middle of a small lake\\r\\namid hills which rise from the water’s edge; for the water in which it is\\r\\nreflected not only makes the best foreground in such a case, but, with its\\r\\nwinding shore, the most natural and agreeable boundary to it. There is no\\r\\nrawness nor imperfection in its edge there, as where the axe has cleared a\\r\\npart, or a cultivated field abuts on it. The trees have ample room to expand on\\r\\nthe water side, and each sends forth its most vigorous branch in that\\r\\ndirection. There Nature has woven a natural selvage, and the eye rises by just\\r\\ngradations from the low shrubs of the shore to the highest trees. There are few\\r\\ntraces of man’s hand to be seen. The water laves the shore as it did a\\r\\nthousand years ago.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA lake is the landscape’s most beautiful and expressive feature. It is\\r\\nearth’s eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his\\r\\nown nature. The fluviatile trees next the shore are the slender eyelashes which\\r\\nfringe it, and the wooded hills and cliffs around are its overhanging brows.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nStanding on the smooth sandy beach at the east end of the pond, in a calm\\r\\nSeptember afternoon, when a slight haze makes the opposite shore line\\r\\nindistinct, I have seen whence came the expression, “the glassy surface\\r\\nof a lake.” When you invert your head, it looks like a thread of finest\\r\\ngossamer stretched across the valley, and gleaming against the distant pine\\r\\nwoods, separating one stratum of the atmosphere from another. You would think\\r\\nthat you could walk dry under it to the opposite hills, and that the swallows\\r\\nwhich skim over might perch on it. Indeed, they sometimes dive below this line,\\r\\nas it were by mistake, and are undeceived. As you look over the pond westward\\r\\nyou are obliged to employ both your hands to defend your eyes against the\\r\\nreflected as well as the true sun, for they are equally bright; and if, between\\r\\nthe two, you survey its surface critically, it is literally as smooth as glass,\\r\\nexcept where the skater insects, at equal intervals scattered over its whole\\r\\nextent, by their motions in the sun produce the finest imaginable sparkle on\\r\\nit, or, perchance, a duck plumes itself, or, as I have said, a swallow skims so\\r\\nlow as to touch it. It may be that in the distance a fish describes an arc of\\r\\nthree or four feet in the air, and there is one bright flash where it emerges,\\r\\nand another where it strikes the water; sometimes the whole silvery arc is\\r\\nrevealed; or here and there, perhaps, is a thistle-down floating on its\\r\\nsurface, which the fishes dart at and so dimple it again. It is like molten\\r\\nglass cooled but not congealed, and the few motes in it are pure and beautiful\\r\\nlike the imperfections in glass. You may often detect a yet smoother and darker\\r\\nwater, separated from the rest as if by an invisible cobweb, boom of the water\\r\\nnymphs, resting on it. From a hill-top you can see a fish leap in almost any\\r\\npart; for not a pickerel or shiner picks an insect from this smooth surface but\\r\\nit manifestly disturbs the equilibrium of the whole lake. It is wonderful with\\r\\nwhat elaborateness this simple fact is advertised,—this piscine murder\\r\\nwill out,—and from my distant perch I distinguish the circling undulations\\r\\nwhen they are half a dozen rods in diameter. You can even detect a water-bug\\r\\n(Gyrinus) ceaselessly progressing over the smooth surface a quarter of a\\r\\nmile off; for they furrow the water slightly, making a conspicuous ripple\\r\\nbounded by two diverging lines, but the skaters glide over it without rippling\\r\\nit perceptibly. When the surface is considerably agitated there are no skaters\\r\\nnor water-bugs on it, but apparently, in calm days, they leave their havens and\\r\\nadventurously glide forth from the shore by short impulses till they completely\\r\\ncover it. It is a soothing employment, on one of those fine days in the fall\\r\\nwhen all the warmth of the sun is fully appreciated, to sit on a stump on such\\r\\na height as this, overlooking the pond, and study the dimpling circles which\\r\\nare incessantly inscribed on its otherwise invisible surface amid the reflected\\r\\nskies and trees. Over this great expanse there is no disturbance but it is thus\\r\\nat once gently smoothed away and assuaged, as, when a vase of water is jarred,\\r\\nthe trembling circles seek the shore and all is smooth again. Not a fish can\\r\\nleap or an insect fall on the pond but it is thus reported in circling dimples,\\r\\nin lines of beauty, as it were the constant welling up of its fountain, the\\r\\ngentle pulsing of its life, the heaving of its breast. The thrills of joy and\\r\\nthrills of pain are undistinguishable. How peaceful the phenomena of the lake!\\r\\nAgain the works of man shine as in the spring. Ay, every leaf and twig and\\r\\nstone and cobweb sparkles now at mid-afternoon as when covered with dew in a\\r\\nspring morning. Every motion of an oar or an insect produces a flash of light;\\r\\nand if an oar falls, how sweet the echo!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn such a day, in September or October, Walden is a perfect forest mirror, set\\r\\nround with stones as precious to my eye as if fewer or rarer. Nothing so fair,\\r\\nso pure, and at the same time so large, as a lake, perchance, lies on the\\r\\nsurface of the earth. Sky water. It needs no fence. Nations come and go without\\r\\ndefiling it. It is a mirror which no stone can crack, whose quicksilver will\\r\\nnever wear off, whose gilding Nature continually repairs; no storms, no dust,\\r\\ncan dim its surface ever fresh;—a mirror in which all impurity presented\\r\\nto it sinks, swept and dusted by the sun’s hazy brush,—this the\\r\\nlight dust-cloth,—which retains no breath that is breathed on it, but\\r\\nsends its own to float as clouds high above its surface, and be reflected in\\r\\nits bosom still.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA field of water betrays the spirit that is in the air. It is continually\\r\\nreceiving new life and motion from above. It is intermediate in its nature\\r\\nbetween land and sky. On land only the grass and trees wave, but the water\\r\\nitself is rippled by the wind. I see where the breeze dashes across it by the\\r\\nstreaks or flakes of light. It is remarkable that we can look down on its\\r\\nsurface. We shall, perhaps, look down thus on the surface of air at length, and\\r\\nmark where a still subtler spirit sweeps over it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe skaters and water-bugs finally disappear in the latter part of October,\\r\\nwhen the severe frosts have come; and then and in November, usually, in a calm\\r\\nday, there is absolutely nothing to ripple the surface. One November afternoon,\\r\\nin the calm at the end of a rain storm of several days’ duration, when\\r\\nthe sky was still completely overcast and the air was full of mist, I observed\\r\\nthat the pond was remarkably smooth, so that it was difficult to distinguish\\r\\nits surface; though it no longer reflected the bright tints of October, but the\\r\\nsombre November colors of the surrounding hills. Though I passed over it as\\r\\ngently as possible, the slight undulations produced by my boat extended almost\\r\\nas far as I could see, and gave a ribbed appearance to the reflections. But, as\\r\\nI was looking over the surface, I saw here and there at a distance a faint\\r\\nglimmer, as if some skater insects which had escaped the frosts might be\\r\\ncollected there, or, perchance, the surface, being so smooth, betrayed where a\\r\\nspring welled up from the bottom. Paddling gently to one of these places, I was\\r\\nsurprised to find myself surrounded by myriads of small perch, about five\\r\\ninches long, of a rich bronze color in the green water, sporting there, and\\r\\nconstantly rising to the surface and dimpling it, sometimes leaving bubbles on\\r\\nit. In such transparent and seemingly bottomless water, reflecting the clouds,\\r\\nI seemed to be floating through the air as in a balloon, and their swimming\\r\\nimpressed me as a kind of flight or hovering, as if they were a compact flock\\r\\nof birds passing just beneath my level on the right or left, their fins, like\\r\\nsails, set all around them. There were many such schools in the pond,\\r\\napparently improving the short season before winter would draw an icy shutter\\r\\nover their broad skylight, sometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if\\r\\na slight breeze struck it, or a few rain-drops fell there. When I approached\\r\\ncarelessly and alarmed them, they made a sudden splash and rippling with their\\r\\ntails, as if one had struck the water with a brushy bough, and instantly took\\r\\nrefuge in the depths. At length the wind rose, the mist increased, and the\\r\\nwaves began to run, and the perch leaped much higher than before, half out of\\r\\nwater, a hundred black points, three inches long, at once above the surface.\\r\\nEven as late as the fifth of December, one year, I saw some dimples on the\\r\\nsurface, and thinking it was going to rain hard immediately, the air being full\\r\\nof mist, I made haste to take my place at the oars and row homeward; already\\r\\nthe rain seemed rapidly increasing, though I felt none on my cheek, and I\\r\\nanticipated a thorough soaking. But suddenly the dimples ceased, for they were\\r\\nproduced by the perch, which the noise of my oars had seared into the depths,\\r\\nand I saw their schools dimly disappearing; so I spent a dry afternoon after\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAn old man who used to frequent this pond nearly sixty years ago, when it was\\r\\ndark with surrounding forests, tells me that in those days he sometimes saw it\\r\\nall alive with ducks and other water fowl, and that there were many eagles\\r\\nabout it. He came here a-fishing, and used an old log canoe which he found on\\r\\nthe shore. It was made of two white-pine logs dug out and pinned together, and\\r\\nwas cut off square at the ends. It was very clumsy, but lasted a great many\\r\\nyears before it became water-logged and perhaps sank to the bottom. He did not\\r\\nknow whose it was; it belonged to the pond. He used to make a cable for his\\r\\nanchor of strips of hickory bark tied together. An old man, a potter, who lived\\r\\nby the pond before the Revolution, told him once that there was an iron chest\\r\\nat the bottom, and that he had seen it. Sometimes it would come floating up to\\r\\nthe shore; but when you went toward it, it would go back into deep water and\\r\\ndisappear. I was pleased to hear of the old log canoe, which took the place of\\r\\nan Indian one of the same material but more graceful construction, which\\r\\nperchance had first been a tree on the bank, and then, as it were, fell into\\r\\nthe water, to float there for a generation, the most proper vessel for the\\r\\nlake. I remember that when I first looked into these depths there were many\\r\\nlarge trunks to be seen indistinctly lying on the bottom, which had either been\\r\\nblown over formerly, or left on the ice at the last cutting, when wood was\\r\\ncheaper; but now they have mostly disappeared.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I first paddled a boat on Walden, it was completely surrounded by thick\\r\\nand lofty pine and oak woods, and in some of its coves grape vines had run over\\r\\nthe trees next the water and formed bowers under which a boat could pass. The\\r\\nhills which form its shores are so steep, and the woods on them were then so\\r\\nhigh, that, as you looked down from the west end, it had the appearance of an\\r\\namphitheatre for some kind of sylvan spectacle. I have spent many an hour, when\\r\\nI was younger, floating over its surface as the zephyr willed, having paddled\\r\\nmy boat to the middle, and lying on my back across the seats, in a summer\\r\\nforenoon, dreaming awake, until I was aroused by the boat touching the sand,\\r\\nand I arose to see what shore my fates had impelled me to; days when idleness\\r\\nwas the most attractive and productive industry. Many a forenoon have I stolen\\r\\naway, preferring to spend thus the most valued part of the day; for I was rich,\\r\\nif not in money, in sunny hours and summer days, and spent them lavishly; nor\\r\\ndo I regret that I did not waste more of them in the workshop or the\\r\\nteacher’s desk. But since I left those shores the woodchoppers have still\\r\\nfurther laid them waste, and now for many a year there will be no more rambling\\r\\nthrough the aisles of the wood, with occasional vistas through which you see\\r\\nthe water. My Muse may be excused if she is silent henceforth. How can you\\r\\nexpect the birds to sing when their groves are cut down?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow the trunks of trees on the bottom, and the old log canoe, and the dark\\r\\nsurrounding woods, are gone, and the villagers, who scarcely know where it\\r\\nlies, instead of going to the pond to bathe or drink, are thinking to bring its\\r\\nwater, which should be as sacred as the Ganges at least, to the village in a\\r\\npipe, to wash their dishes with!—to earn their Walden by the turning of a\\r\\ncock or drawing of a plug! That devilish Iron Horse, whose ear-rending neigh is\\r\\nheard throughout the town, has muddied the Boiling Spring with his foot, and he\\r\\nit is that has browsed off all the woods on Walden shore, that Trojan horse,\\r\\nwith a thousand men in his belly, introduced by mercenary Greeks! Where is the\\r\\ncountry’s champion, the Moore of Moore Hill, to meet him at the Deep Cut\\r\\nand thrust an avenging lance between the ribs of the bloated pest?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, of all the characters I have known, perhaps Walden wears best,\\r\\nand best preserves its purity. Many men have been likened to it, but few\\r\\ndeserve that honor. Though the woodchoppers have laid bare first this shore and\\r\\nthen that, and the Irish have built their sties by it, and the railroad has\\r\\ninfringed on its border, and the ice-men have skimmed it once, it is itself\\r\\nunchanged, the same water which my youthful eyes fell on; all the change is in\\r\\nme. It has not acquired one permanent wrinkle after all its ripples. It is\\r\\nperennially young, and I may stand and see a swallow dip apparently to pick an\\r\\ninsect from its surface as of yore. It struck me again tonight, as if I had not\\r\\nseen it almost daily for more than twenty years,—Why, here is Walden, the\\r\\nsame woodland lake that I discovered so many years ago; where a forest was cut\\r\\ndown last winter another is springing up by its shore as lustily as ever; the\\r\\nsame thought is welling up to its surface that was then; it is the same liquid\\r\\njoy and happiness to itself and its Maker, ay, and it may be to me. It\\r\\nis the work of a brave man surely, in whom there was no guile! He rounded this\\r\\nwater with his hand, deepened and clarified it in his thought, and in his will\\r\\nbequeathed it to Concord. I see by its face that it is visited by the same\\r\\nreflection; and I can almost say, Walden, is it you?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is no dream of mine,\\r\\nTo ornament a line;\\r\\nI cannot come nearer to God and Heaven\\r\\nThan I live to Walden even.\\r\\nI am its stony shore,\\r\\nAnd the breeze that passes o’er;\\r\\nIn the hollow of my hand\\r\\nAre its water and its sand,\\r\\nAnd its deepest resort\\r\\nLies high in my thought.\\n\\n\\r\\nThe cars never pause to look at it; yet I fancy that the engineers and firemen\\r\\nand brakemen, and those passengers who have a season ticket and see it often,\\r\\nare better men for the sight. The engineer does not forget at night, or his\\r\\nnature does not, that he has beheld this vision of serenity and purity once at\\r\\nleast during the day. Though seen but once, it helps to wash out State-street\\r\\nand the engine’s soot. One proposes that it be called “God’s\\r\\nDrop.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have said that Walden has no visible inlet nor outlet, but it is on the one\\r\\nhand distantly and indirectly related to Flint’s Pond, which is more\\r\\nelevated, by a chain of small ponds coming from that quarter, and on the other\\r\\ndirectly and manifestly to Concord River, which is lower, by a similar chain of\\r\\nponds through which in some other geological period it may have flowed, and by\\r\\na little digging, which God forbid, it can be made to flow thither again. If by\\r\\nliving thus reserved and austere, like a hermit in the woods, so long, it has\\r\\nacquired such wonderful purity, who would not regret that the comparatively\\r\\nimpure waters of Flint’s Pond should be mingled with it, or itself should\\r\\never go to waste its sweetness in the ocean wave?\\n\\n\\r\\nFlint’s, or Sandy Pond, in Lincoln, our greatest lake and inland sea,\\r\\nlies about a mile east of Walden. It is much larger, being said to contain one\\r\\nhundred and ninety-seven acres, and is more fertile in fish; but it is\\r\\ncomparatively shallow, and not remarkably pure. A walk through the woods\\r\\nthither was often my recreation. It was worth the while, if only to feel the\\r\\nwind blow on your cheek freely, and see the waves run, and remember the life of\\r\\nmariners. I went a-chestnutting there in the fall, on windy days, when the nuts\\r\\nwere dropping into the water and were washed to my feet; and one day, as I\\r\\ncrept along its sedgy shore, the fresh spray blowing in my face, I came upon\\r\\nthe mouldering wreck of a boat, the sides gone, and hardly more than the\\r\\nimpression of its flat bottom left amid the rushes; yet its model was sharply\\r\\ndefined, as if it were a large decayed pad, with its veins. It was as\\r\\nimpressive a wreck as one could imagine on the sea-shore, and had as good a\\r\\nmoral. It is by this time mere vegetable mould and undistinguishable pond\\r\\nshore, through which rushes and flags have pushed up. I used to admire the\\r\\nripple marks on the sandy bottom, at the north end of this pond, made firm and\\r\\nhard to the feet of the wader by the pressure of the water, and the rushes\\r\\nwhich grew in Indian file, in waving lines, corresponding to these marks, rank\\r\\nbehind rank, as if the waves had planted them. There also I have found, in\\r\\nconsiderable quantities, curious balls, composed apparently of fine grass or\\r\\nroots, of pipewort perhaps, from half an inch to four inches in diameter, and\\r\\nperfectly spherical. These wash back and forth in shallow water on a sandy\\r\\nbottom, and are sometimes cast on the shore. They are either solid grass, or\\r\\nhave a little sand in the middle. At first you would say that they were formed\\r\\nby the action of the waves, like a pebble; yet the smallest are made of equally\\r\\ncoarse materials, half an inch long, and they are produced only at one season\\r\\nof the year. Moreover, the waves, I suspect, do not so much construct as wear\\r\\ndown a material which has already acquired consistency. They preserve their\\r\\nform when dry for an indefinite period.\\r\\n\\n\\nFlint’s Pond! Such is the poverty of our nomenclature. What right\\r\\nhad the unclean and stupid farmer, whose farm abutted on this sky water, whose\\r\\nshores he has ruthlessly laid bare, to give his name to it? Some skin-flint,\\r\\nwho loved better the reflecting surface of a dollar, or a bright cent, in which\\r\\nhe could see his own brazen face; who regarded even the wild ducks which\\r\\nsettled in it as trespassers; his fingers grown into crooked and horny talons\\r\\nfrom the long habit of grasping harpy-like;—so it is not named for me. I\\r\\ngo not there to see him nor to hear of him; who never saw it, who never\\r\\nbathed in it, who never loved it, who never protected it, who never spoke a\\r\\ngood word for it, nor thanked God that he had made it. Rather let it be named\\r\\nfrom the fishes that swim in it, the wild fowl or quadrupeds which frequent it,\\r\\nthe wild flowers which grow by its shores, or some wild man or child the thread\\r\\nof whose history is interwoven with its own; not from him who could show no\\r\\ntitle to it but the deed which a like-minded neighbor or legislature gave\\r\\nhim,—him who thought only of its money value; whose presence perchance\\r\\ncursed all the shore; who exhausted the land around it, and would fain have\\r\\nexhausted the waters within it; who regretted only that it was not English hay\\r\\nor cranberry meadow,—there was nothing to redeem it, forsooth, in his\\r\\neyes,—and would have drained and sold it for the mud at its bottom. It did\\r\\nnot turn his mill, and it was no privilege to him to behold it. I\\r\\nrespect not his labors, his farm where every thing has its price; who would\\r\\ncarry the landscape, who would carry his God, to market, if he could get\\r\\nany thing for him; who goes to market for his god as it is; on whose farm\\r\\nnothing grows free, whose fields bear no crops, whose meadows no flowers, whose\\r\\ntrees no fruits, but dollars; who loves not the beauty of his fruits, whose\\r\\nfruits are not ripe for him till they are turned to dollars. Give me the\\r\\npoverty that enjoys true wealth. Farmers are respectable and interesting to me\\r\\nin proportion as they are poor,—poor farmers. A model farm! where the\\r\\nhouse stands like a fungus in a muck-heap, chambers for men, horses, oxen, and\\r\\nswine, cleansed and uncleansed, all contiguous to one another! Stocked with\\r\\nmen! A great grease-spot, redolent of manures and buttermilk! Under a high\\r\\nstate of cultivation, being manured with the hearts and brains of men! As if\\r\\nyou were to raise your potatoes in the church-yard! Such is a model farm.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNo, no; if the fairest features of the landscape are to be named after men, let\\r\\nthem be the noblest and worthiest men alone. Let our lakes receive as true\\r\\nnames at least as the Icarian Sea, where “still the shore” a\\r\\n“brave attempt resounds.”\\n\\n\\r\\nGoose Pond, of small extent, is on my way to Flint’s; Fair-Haven, an\\r\\nexpansion of Concord River, said to contain some seventy acres, is a mile\\r\\nsouth-west; and White Pond, of about forty acres, is a mile and a half beyond\\r\\nFair-Haven. This is my lake country. These, with Concord River, are my water\\r\\nprivileges; and night and day, year in year out, they grind such grist as I\\r\\ncarry to them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSince the woodcutters, and the railroad, and I myself have profaned Walden,\\r\\nperhaps the most attractive, if not the most beautiful, of all our lakes, the\\r\\ngem of the woods, is White Pond;—a poor name from its commonness, whether\\r\\nderived from the remarkable purity of its waters or the color of its sands. In\\r\\nthese as in other respects, however, it is a lesser twin of Walden. They are so\\r\\nmuch alike that you would say they must be connected under ground. It has the\\r\\nsame stony shore, and its waters are of the same hue. As at Walden, in sultry\\r\\ndog-day weather, looking down through the woods on some of its bays which are\\r\\nnot so deep but that the reflection from the bottom tinges them, its waters are\\r\\nof a misty bluish-green or glaucous color. Many years since I used to go there\\r\\nto collect the sand by cart-loads, to make sand-paper with, and I have\\r\\ncontinued to visit it ever since. One who frequents it proposes to call it\\r\\nVirid Lake. Perhaps it might be called Yellow-Pine Lake, from the following\\r\\ncircumstance. About fifteen years ago you could see the top of a pitch-pine, of\\r\\nthe kind called yellow-pine hereabouts, though it is not a distinct species,\\r\\nprojecting above the surface in deep water, many rods from the shore. It was\\r\\neven supposed by some that the pond had sunk, and this was one of the primitive\\r\\nforest that formerly stood there. I find that even so long ago as 1792, in a\\r\\n“Topographical Description of the Town of Concord,” by one of its\\r\\ncitizens, in the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, the\\r\\nauthor, after speaking of Walden and White Ponds, adds: “In the middle of\\r\\nthe latter may be seen, when the water is very low, a tree which appears as if\\r\\nit grew in the place where it now stands, although the roots are fifty feet\\r\\nbelow the surface of the water; the top of this tree is broken off, and at that\\r\\nplace measures fourteen inches in diameter.” In the spring of ’49 I\\r\\ntalked with the man who lives nearest the pond in Sudbury, who told me that it\\r\\nwas he who got out this tree ten or fifteen years before. As near as he could\\r\\nremember, it stood twelve or fifteen rods from the shore, where the water was\\r\\nthirty or forty feet deep. It was in the winter, and he had been getting out\\r\\nice in the forenoon, and had resolved that in the afternoon, with the aid of\\r\\nhis neighbors, he would take out the old yellow-pine. He sawed a channel in the\\r\\nice toward the shore, and hauled it over and along and out on to the ice with\\r\\noxen; but, before he had gone far in his work, he was surprised to find that it\\r\\nwas wrong end upward, with the stumps of the branches pointing down, and the\\r\\nsmall end firmly fastened in the sandy bottom. It was about a foot in diameter\\r\\nat the big end, and he had expected to get a good saw-log, but it was so rotten\\r\\nas to be fit only for fuel, if for that. He had some of it in his shed then.\\r\\nThere were marks of an axe and of woodpeckers on the butt. He thought that it\\r\\nmight have been a dead tree on the shore, but was finally blown over into the\\r\\npond, and after the top had become waterlogged, while the butt-end was still\\r\\ndry and light, had drifted out and sunk wrong end up. His father, eighty years\\r\\nold, could not remember when it was not there. Several pretty large logs may\\r\\nstill be seen lying on the bottom, where, owing to the undulation of the\\r\\nsurface, they look like huge water snakes in motion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis pond has rarely been profaned by a boat, for there is little in it to\\r\\ntempt a fisherman. Instead of the white lily, which requires mud, or the common\\r\\nsweet flag, the blue flag (Iris versicolor) grows thinly in the pure\\r\\nwater, rising from the stony bottom all around the shore, where it is visited\\r\\nby humming birds in June; and the color both of its bluish blades and its\\r\\nflowers, and especially their reflections, are in singular harmony with the\\r\\nglaucous water.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhite Pond and Walden are great crystals on the surface of the earth, Lakes of\\r\\nLight. If they were permanently congealed, and small enough to be clutched,\\r\\nthey would, perchance, be carried off by slaves, like precious stones, to adorn\\r\\nthe heads of emperors; but being liquid, and ample, and secured to us and our\\r\\nsuccessors forever, we disregard them, and run after the diamond of Kohinoor.\\r\\nThey are too pure to have a market value; they contain no muck. How much more\\r\\nbeautiful than our lives, how much more transparent than our characters, are\\r\\nthey! We never learned meanness of them. How much fairer than the pool before\\r\\nthe farmer’s door, in which his ducks swim! Hither the clean wild ducks\\r\\ncome. Nature has no human inhabitant who appreciates her. The birds with their\\r\\nplumage and their notes are in harmony with the flowers, but what youth or\\r\\nmaiden conspires with the wild luxuriant beauty of Nature? She flourishes most\\r\\nalone, far from the towns where they reside. Talk of heaven! ye disgrace earth.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Baker Farm\\n\\r\\nSometimes I rambled to pine groves, standing like temples, or like fleets at\\r\\nsea, full-rigged, with wavy boughs, and rippling with light, so soft and green\\r\\nand shady that the Druids would have forsaken their oaks to worship in them; or\\r\\nto the cedar wood beyond Flint’s Pond, where the trees, covered with\\r\\nhoary blue berries, spiring higher and higher, are fit to stand before\\r\\nValhalla, and the creeping juniper covers the ground with wreaths full of\\r\\nfruit; or to swamps where the usnea lichen hangs in festoons from the\\r\\nwhite-spruce trees, and toad-stools, round tables of the swamp gods, cover the\\r\\nground, and more beautiful fungi adorn the stumps, like butterflies or shells,\\r\\nvegetable winkles; where the swamp-pink and dogwood grow, the red alder-berry\\r\\nglows like eyes of imps, the waxwork grooves and crushes the hardest woods in\\r\\nits folds, and the wild-holly berries make the beholder forget his home with\\r\\ntheir beauty, and he is dazzled and tempted by nameless other wild forbidden\\r\\nfruits, too fair for mortal taste. Instead of calling on some scholar, I paid\\r\\nmany a visit to particular trees, of kinds which are rare in this neighborhood,\\r\\nstanding far away in the middle of some pasture, or in the depths of a wood or\\r\\nswamp, or on a hill-top; such as the black-birch, of which we have some handsome\\r\\nspecimens two feet in diameter; its cousin, the yellow birch, with its loose\\r\\ngolden vest, perfumed like the first; the beech, which has so neat a bole and\\r\\nbeautifully lichen-painted, perfect in all its details, of which, excepting\\r\\nscattered specimens, I know but one small grove of sizable trees left in the\\r\\ntownship, supposed by some to have been planted by the pigeons that were once\\r\\nbaited with beech nuts near by; it is worth the while to see the silver grain\\r\\nsparkle when you split this wood; the bass; the hornbeam; the Celtis\\r\\noccidentalis, or false elm, of which we have but one well-grown; some\\r\\ntaller mast of a pine, a shingle tree, or a more perfect hemlock than usual,\\r\\nstanding like a pagoda in the midst of the woods; and many others I could\\r\\nmention. These were the shrines I visited both summer and winter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOnce it chanced that I stood in the very abutment of a rainbow’s arch,\\r\\nwhich filled the lower stratum of the atmosphere, tinging the grass and leaves\\r\\naround, and dazzling me as if I looked through colored crystal. It was a lake\\r\\nof rainbow light, in which, for a short while, I lived like a dolphin. If it\\r\\nhad lasted longer it might have tinged my employments and life. As I walked on\\r\\nthe railroad causeway, I used to wonder at the halo of light around my shadow,\\r\\nand would fain fancy myself one of the elect. One who visited me declared that\\r\\nthe shadows of some Irishmen before him had no halo about them, that it was\\r\\nonly natives that were so distinguished. Benvenuto Cellini tells us in his\\r\\nmemoirs, that, after a certain terrible dream or vision which he had during his\\r\\nconfinement in the castle of St. Angelo, a resplendent light appeared over the\\r\\nshadow of his head at morning and evening, whether he was in Italy or France,\\r\\nand it was particularly conspicuous when the grass was moist with dew. This was\\r\\nprobably the same phenomenon to which I have referred, which is especially\\r\\nobserved in the morning, but also at other times, and even by moonlight. Though\\r\\na constant one, it is not commonly noticed, and, in the case of an excitable\\r\\nimagination like Cellini’s, it would be basis enough for superstition.\\r\\nBeside, he tells us that he showed it to very few. But are they not indeed\\r\\ndistinguished who are conscious that they are regarded at all?\\n\\n\\r\\nI set out one afternoon to go a-fishing to Fair-Haven, through the woods, to\\r\\neke out my scanty fare of vegetables. My way led through Pleasant Meadow, an\\r\\nadjunct of the Baker Farm, that retreat of which a poet has since sung,\\r\\nbeginning,—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thy entry is a pleasant field,\\r\\nWhich some mossy fruit trees yield\\r\\nPartly to a ruddy brook,\\r\\nBy gliding musquash undertook,\\r\\nAnd mercurial trout,\\r\\nDarting about.”\\n\\n\\r\\nI thought of living there before I went to Walden. I “hooked” the\\r\\napples, leaped the brook, and scared the musquash and the trout. It was one of\\r\\nthose afternoons which seem indefinitely long before one, in which many events\\r\\nmay happen, a large portion of our natural life, though it was already half\\r\\nspent when I started. By the way there came up a shower, which compelled me to\\r\\nstand half an hour under a pine, piling boughs over my head, and wearing my\\r\\nhandkerchief for a shed; and when at length I had made one cast over the\\r\\npickerel-weed, standing up to my middle in water, I found myself suddenly in the\\r\\nshadow of a cloud, and the thunder began to rumble with such emphasis that I\\r\\ncould do no more than listen to it. The gods must be proud, thought I, with\\r\\nsuch forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman. So I made haste for\\r\\nshelter to the nearest hut, which stood half a mile from any road, but so much\\r\\nthe nearer to the pond, and had long been uninhabited:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And here a poet builded,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0In the completed years,\\r\\nFor behold a trivial cabin\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0That to destruction steers.”\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Muse fables. But therein, as I found, dwelt now John Field, an Irishman,\\r\\nand his wife, and several children, from the broad-faced boy who assisted his\\r\\nfather at his work, and now came running by his side from the bog to escape the\\r\\nrain, to the wrinkled, sibyl-like, cone-headed infant that sat upon its\\r\\nfather’s knee as in the palaces of nobles, and looked out from its home\\r\\nin the midst of wet and hunger inquisitively upon the stranger, with the\\r\\nprivilege of infancy, not knowing but it was the last of a noble line, and the\\r\\nhope and cynosure of the world, instead of John Field’s poor starveling\\r\\nbrat. There we sat together under that part of the roof which leaked the least,\\r\\nwhile it showered and thundered without. I had sat there many times of old\\r\\nbefore the ship was built that floated his family to America. An honest,\\r\\nhard-working, but shiftless man plainly was John Field; and his wife, she too\\r\\nwas brave to cook so many successive dinners in the recesses of that lofty\\r\\nstove; with round greasy face and bare breast, still thinking to improve her\\r\\ncondition one day; with the never absent mop in one hand, and yet no effects of\\r\\nit visible anywhere. The chickens, which had also taken shelter here from the\\r\\nrain, stalked about the room like members of the family, too humanized\\r\\nmethought to roast well. They stood and looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe\\r\\nsignificantly. Meanwhile my host told me his story, how hard he worked\\r\\n“bogging” for a neighboring farmer, turning up a meadow with a\\r\\nspade or bog hoe at the rate of ten dollars an acre and the use of the land\\r\\nwith manure for one year, and his little broad-faced son worked cheerfully at\\r\\nhis father’s side the while, not knowing how poor a bargain the latter\\r\\nhad made. I tried to help him with my experience, telling him that he was one\\r\\nof my nearest neighbors, and that I too, who came a-fishing here, and looked\\r\\nlike a loafer, was getting my living like himself; that I lived in a tight,\\r\\nlight, and clean house, which hardly cost more than the annual rent of such a\\r\\nruin as his commonly amounts to; and how, if he chose, he might in a month or\\r\\ntwo build himself a palace of his own; that I did not use tea, nor coffee, nor\\r\\nbutter, nor milk, nor fresh meat, and so did not have to work to get them;\\r\\nagain, as I did not work hard, I did not have to eat hard, and it cost me but a\\r\\ntrifle for my food; but as he began with tea, and coffee, and butter, and milk,\\r\\nand beef, he had to work hard to pay for them, and when he had worked hard he\\r\\nhad to eat hard again to repair the waste of his system,—and so it was as\\r\\nbroad as it was long, indeed it was broader than it was long, for he was\\r\\ndiscontented and wasted his life into the bargain; and yet he had rated it as a\\r\\ngain in coming to America, that here you could get tea, and coffee, and meat\\r\\nevery day. But the only true America is that country where you are at liberty\\r\\nto pursue such a mode of life as may enable you to do without these, and where\\r\\nthe state does not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and\\r\\nother superfluous expenses which directly or indirectly result from the use of\\r\\nsuch things. For I purposely talked to him as if he were a philosopher, or\\r\\ndesired to be one. I should be glad if all the meadows on the earth were left\\r\\nin a wild state, if that were the consequence of men’s beginning to\\r\\nredeem themselves. A man will not need to study history to find out what is\\r\\nbest for his own culture. But alas! the culture of an Irishman is an enterprise\\r\\nto be undertaken with a sort of moral bog hoe. I told him, that as he worked so\\r\\nhard at bogging, he required thick boots and stout clothing, which yet were\\r\\nsoon soiled and worn out, but I wore light shoes and thin clothing, which cost\\r\\nnot half so much, though he might think that I was dressed like a gentleman,\\r\\n(which, however, was not the case,) and in an hour or two, without labor, but\\r\\nas a recreation, I could, if I wished, catch as many fish as I should want for\\r\\ntwo days, or earn enough money to support me a week. If he and his family would\\r\\nlive simply, they might all go a-huckleberrying in the summer for their\\r\\namusement. John heaved a sigh at this, and his wife stared with arms a-kimbo,\\r\\nand both appeared to be wondering if they had capital enough to begin such a\\r\\ncourse with, or arithmetic enough to carry it through. It was sailing by dead\\r\\nreckoning to them, and they saw not clearly how to make their port so;\\r\\ntherefore I suppose they still take life bravely, after their fashion, face to\\r\\nface, giving it tooth and nail, not having skill to split its massive columns\\r\\nwith any fine entering wedge, and rout it in detail;—thinking to deal\\r\\nwith it roughly, as one should handle a thistle. But they fight at an\\r\\noverwhelming disadvantage,—living, John Field, alas! without arithmetic,\\r\\nand failing so.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you ever fish?” I asked. “Oh yes, I catch a mess now and\\r\\nthen when I am lying by; good perch I catch.” “What’s\\r\\nyour bait?” “I catch shiners with fish-worms, and bait the perch\\r\\nwith them.” “You’d better go now, John,” said his wife,\\r\\nwith glistening and hopeful face; but John demurred.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe shower was now over, and a rainbow above the eastern woods promised a fair\\r\\nevening; so I took my departure. When I had got without I asked for a drink,\\r\\nhoping to get a sight of the well bottom, to complete my survey of the\\r\\npremises; but there, alas! are shallows and quicksands, and rope broken withal,\\r\\nand bucket irrecoverable. Meanwhile the right culinary vessel was selected,\\r\\nwater was seemingly distilled, and after consultation and long delay passed out\\r\\nto the thirsty one,—not yet suffered to cool, not yet to settle. Such\\r\\ngruel sustains life here, I thought; so, shutting my eyes, and excluding the\\r\\nmotes by a skilfully directed under-current, I drank to genuine hospitality the\\r\\nheartiest draught I could. I am not squeamish in such cases when manners are\\r\\nconcerned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I was leaving the Irishman’s roof after the rain, bending my steps\\r\\nagain to the pond, my haste to catch pickerel, wading in retired meadows, in\\r\\nsloughs and bog-holes, in forlorn and savage places, appeared for an instant\\r\\ntrivial to me who had been sent to school and college; but as I ran down the\\r\\nhill toward the reddening west, with the rainbow over my shoulder, and some\\r\\nfaint tinkling sounds borne to my ear through the cleansed air, from I know not\\r\\nwhat quarter, my Good Genius seemed to say,—Go fish and hunt far and wide\\r\\nday by day,—farther and wider,—and rest thee by many brooks and\\r\\nhearth-sides without misgiving. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth.\\r\\nRise free from care before the dawn, and seek adventures. Let the noon find\\r\\nthee by other lakes, and the night overtake thee everywhere at home. There are\\r\\nno larger fields than these, no worthier games than may here be played. Grow\\r\\nwild according to thy nature, like these sedges and brakes, which will never\\r\\nbecome English hay. Let the thunder rumble; what if it threaten ruin to\\r\\nfarmers’ crops? that is not its errand to thee. Take shelter under the\\r\\ncloud, while they flee to carts and sheds. Let not to get a living be thy\\r\\ntrade, but thy sport. Enjoy the land, but own it not. Through want of\\r\\nenterprise and faith men are where they are, buying and selling, and spending\\r\\ntheir lives like serfs.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nO Baker Farm!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Landscape where the richest element\\r\\nIs a little sunshine innocent.” * *\\r\\n\\r\\n“No one runs to revel\\r\\nOn thy rail-fenced lea.” * *\\r\\n\\r\\n“Debate with no man hast thou,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0With questions art never perplexed,\\r\\nAs tame at the first sight as now,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0In thy plain russet gabardine dressed.” * *\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come ye who love,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0And ye who hate,\\r\\nChildren of the Holy Dove,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0And Guy Faux of the state,\\r\\nAnd hang conspiracies\\r\\nFrom the tough rafters of the trees!”\\n\\n\\r\\nMen come tamely home at night only from the next field or street, where their\\r\\nhousehold echoes haunt, and their life pines because it breathes its own breath\\r\\nover again; their shadows morning and evening reach farther than their daily\\r\\nsteps. We should come home from far, from adventures, and perils, and\\r\\ndiscoveries every day, with new experience and character.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBefore I had reached the pond some fresh impulse had brought out John Field,\\r\\nwith altered mind, letting go “bogging” ere this sunset. But he,\\r\\npoor man, disturbed only a couple of fins while I was catching a fair string,\\r\\nand he said it was his luck; but when we changed seats in the boat luck changed\\r\\nseats too. Poor John Field!—I trust he does not read this, unless he will\\r\\nimprove by it,—thinking to live by some derivative old country mode in\\r\\nthis primitive new country,—to catch perch with shiners. It is good bait\\r\\nsometimes, I allow. With his horizon all his own, yet he a poor man, born to be\\r\\npoor, with his inherited Irish poverty or poor life, his Adam’s\\r\\ngrandmother and boggy ways, not to rise in this world, he nor his posterity,\\r\\ntill their wading webbed bog-trotting feet get talaria to their heels.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Higher Laws\\n\\r\\nAs I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my pole, it\\r\\nbeing now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across my\\r\\npath, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight, and was strongly tempted to\\r\\nseize and devour him raw; not that I was hungry then, except for that wildness\\r\\nwhich he represented. Once or twice, however, while I lived at the pond, I\\r\\nfound myself ranging the woods, like a half-starved hound, with a strange\\r\\nabandonment, seeking some kind of venison which I might devour, and no morsel\\r\\ncould have been too savage for me. The wildest scenes had become unaccountably\\r\\nfamiliar. I found in myself, and still find, an instinct toward a higher, or,\\r\\nas it is named, spiritual life, as do most men, and another toward a primitive\\r\\nrank and savage one, and I reverence them both. I love the wild not less than\\r\\nthe good. The wildness and adventure that are in fishing still recommended it\\r\\nto me. I like sometimes to take rank hold on life and spend my day more as the\\r\\nanimals do. Perhaps I have owed to this employment and to hunting, when quite\\r\\nyoung, my closest acquaintance with Nature. They early introduce us to and\\r\\ndetain us in scenery with which otherwise, at that age, we should have little\\r\\nacquaintance. Fishermen, hunters, woodchoppers, and others, spending their\\r\\nlives in the fields and woods, in a peculiar sense a part of Nature themselves,\\r\\nare often in a more favorable mood for observing her, in the intervals of their\\r\\npursuits, than philosophers or poets even, who approach her with expectation.\\r\\nShe is not afraid to exhibit herself to them. The traveller on the prairie is\\r\\nnaturally a hunter, on the head waters of the Missouri and Columbia a trapper,\\r\\nand at the Falls of St. Mary a fisherman. He who is only a traveller learns\\r\\nthings at second-hand and by the halves, and is poor authority. We are most\\r\\ninterested when science reports what those men already know practically or\\r\\ninstinctively, for that alone is a true humanity, or account of human\\r\\nexperience.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey mistake who assert that the Yankee has few amusements, because he has not\\r\\nso many public holidays, and men and boys do not play so many games as they do\\r\\nin England, for here the more primitive but solitary amusements of hunting\\r\\nfishing and the like have not yet given place to the former. Almost every New\\r\\nEngland boy among my contemporaries shouldered a fowling piece between the ages\\r\\nof ten and fourteen; and his hunting and fishing grounds were not limited, like\\r\\nthe preserves of an English nobleman, but were more boundless even than those\\r\\nof a savage. No wonder, then, that he did not oftener stay to play on the\\r\\ncommon. But already a change is taking place, owing, not to an increased\\r\\nhumanity, but to an increased scarcity of game, for perhaps the hunter is the\\r\\ngreatest friend of the animals hunted, not excepting the Humane Society.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMoreover, when at the pond, I wished sometimes to add fish to my fare for\\r\\nvariety. I have actually fished from the same kind of necessity that the first\\r\\nfishers did. Whatever humanity I might conjure up against it was all\\r\\nfactitious, and concerned my philosophy more than my feelings. I speak of\\r\\nfishing only now, for I had long felt differently about fowling, and sold my\\r\\ngun before I went to the woods. Not that I am less humane than others, but I\\r\\ndid not perceive that my feelings were much affected. I did not pity the fishes\\r\\nnor the worms. This was habit. As for fowling, during the last years that I\\r\\ncarried a gun my excuse was that I was studying ornithology, and sought only\\r\\nnew or rare birds. But I confess that I am now inclined to think that there is\\r\\na finer way of studying ornithology than this. It requires so much closer\\r\\nattention to the habits of the birds, that, if for that reason only, I have\\r\\nbeen willing to omit the gun. Yet notwithstanding the objection on the score of\\r\\nhumanity, I am compelled to doubt if equally valuable sports are ever\\r\\nsubstituted for these; and when some of my friends have asked me anxiously\\r\\nabout their boys, whether they should let them hunt, I have answered,\\r\\nyes,—remembering that it was one of the best parts of my\\r\\neducation,—make them hunters, though sportsmen only at first, if\\r\\npossible, mighty hunters at last, so that they shall not find game large enough\\r\\nfor them in this or any vegetable wilderness,—hunters as well as fishers\\r\\nof men. Thus far I am of the opinion of Chaucer’s nun, who\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“yave not of the text a pulled hen\\r\\nThat saith that hunters ben not holy men.”\\n\\n\\r\\nThere is a period in the history of the individual, as of the race, when the\\r\\nhunters are the “best men,” as the Algonquins called them. We\\r\\ncannot but pity the boy who has never fired a gun; he is no more humane, while\\r\\nhis education has been sadly neglected. This was my answer with respect to\\r\\nthose youths who were bent on this pursuit, trusting that they would soon\\r\\noutgrow it. No humane being, past the thoughtless age of boyhood, will wantonly\\r\\nmurder any creature which holds its life by the same tenure that he does. The\\r\\nhare in its extremity cries like a child. I warn you, mothers, that my\\r\\nsympathies do not always make the usual phil-anthropic distinctions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSuch is oftenest the young man’s introduction to the forest, and the most\\r\\noriginal part of himself. He goes thither at first as a hunter and fisher,\\r\\nuntil at last, if he has the seeds of a better life in him, he distinguishes\\r\\nhis proper objects, as a poet or naturalist it may be, and leaves the gun and\\r\\nfish-pole behind. The mass of men are still and always young in this respect.\\r\\nIn some countries a hunting parson is no uncommon sight. Such a one might make\\r\\na good shepherd’s dog, but is far from being the Good Shepherd. I have\\r\\nbeen surprised to consider that the only obvious employment, except\\r\\nwood-chopping, ice-cutting, or the like business, which ever to my knowledge\\r\\ndetained at Walden Pond for a whole half day any of my fellow-citizens, whether\\r\\nfathers or children of the town, with just one exception, was fishing. Commonly\\r\\nthey did not think that they were lucky, or well paid for their time, unless\\r\\nthey got a long string of fish, though they had the opportunity of seeing the\\r\\npond all the while. They might go there a thousand times before the sediment of\\r\\nfishing would sink to the bottom and leave their purpose pure; but no doubt\\r\\nsuch a clarifying process would be going on all the while. The governor and his\\r\\ncouncil faintly remember the pond, for they went a-fishing there when they were\\r\\nboys; but now they are too old and dignified to go a-fishing, and so they know\\r\\nit no more forever. Yet even they expect to go to heaven at last. If the\\r\\nlegislature regards it, it is chiefly to regulate the number of hooks to be\\r\\nused there; but they know nothing about the hook of hooks with which to angle\\r\\nfor the pond itself, impaling the legislature for a bait. Thus, even in\\r\\ncivilized communities, the embryo man passes through the hunter stage of\\r\\ndevelopment.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have found repeatedly, of late years, that I cannot fish without falling a\\r\\nlittle in self-respect. I have tried it again and again. I have skill at it,\\r\\nand, like many of my fellows, a certain instinct for it, which revives from\\r\\ntime to time, but always when I have done I feel that it would have been better\\r\\nif I had not fished. I think that I do not mistake. It is a faint intimation,\\r\\nyet so are the first streaks of morning. There is unquestionably this instinct\\r\\nin me which belongs to the lower orders of creation; yet with every year I am\\r\\nless a fisherman, though without more humanity or even wisdom; at present I am\\r\\nno fisherman at all. But I see that if I were to live in a wilderness I should\\r\\nagain be tempted to become a fisher and hunter in earnest. Beside, there is\\r\\nsomething essentially unclean about this diet and all flesh, and I began to see\\r\\nwhere housework commences, and whence the endeavor, which costs so much, to\\r\\nwear a tidy and respectable appearance each day, to keep the house sweet and\\r\\nfree from all ill odors and sights. Having been my own butcher and scullion and\\r\\ncook, as well as the gentleman for whom the dishes were served up, I can speak\\r\\nfrom an unusually complete experience. The practical objection to animal food\\r\\nin my case was its uncleanness; and, besides, when I had caught and cleaned and\\r\\ncooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially. It was\\r\\ninsignificant and unnecessary, and cost more than it came to. A little bread or\\r\\na few potatoes would have done as well, with less trouble and filth. Like many\\r\\nof my contemporaries, I had rarely for many years used animal food, or tea, or\\r\\ncoffee, &c.; not so much because of any ill effects which I had traced to\\r\\nthem, as because they were not agreeable to my imagination. The repugnance to\\r\\nanimal food is not the effect of experience, but is an instinct. It appeared\\r\\nmore beautiful to live low and fare hard in many respects; and though I never\\r\\ndid so, I went far enough to please my imagination. I believe that every man\\r\\nwho has ever been earnest to preserve his higher or poetic faculties in the\\r\\nbest condition has been particularly inclined to abstain from animal food, and\\r\\nfrom much food of any kind. It is a significant fact, stated by entomologists,\\r\\nI find it in Kirby and Spence, that “some insects in their perfect state,\\r\\nthough furnished with organs of feeding, make no use of them;” and they\\r\\nlay it down as “a general rule, that almost all insects in this state eat\\r\\nmuch less than in that of larvÃ¦. The voracious caterpillar when transformed\\r\\ninto a butterfly,” . . “and the gluttonous maggot when become a\\r\\nfly,” content themselves with a drop or two of honey or some other sweet\\r\\nliquid. The abdomen under the wings of the butterfly still represents the\\r\\nlarva. This is the tid-bit which tempts his insectivorous fate. The gross\\r\\nfeeder is a man in the larva state; and there are whole nations in that\\r\\ncondition, nations without fancy or imagination, whose vast abdomens betray\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is hard to provide and cook so simple and clean a diet as will not offend\\r\\nthe imagination; but this, I think, is to be fed when we feed the body; they\\r\\nshould both sit down at the same table. Yet perhaps this may be done. The\\r\\nfruits eaten temperately need not make us ashamed of our appetites, nor\\r\\ninterrupt the worthiest pursuits. But put an extra condiment into your dish,\\r\\nand it will poison you. It is not worth the while to live by rich cookery. Most\\r\\nmen would feel shame if caught preparing with their own hands precisely such a\\r\\ndinner, whether of animal or vegetable food, as is every day prepared for them\\r\\nby others. Yet till this is otherwise we are not civilized, and, if gentlemen\\r\\nand ladies, are not true men and women. This certainly suggests what change is\\r\\nto be made. It may be vain to ask why the imagination will not be reconciled to\\r\\nflesh and fat. I am satisfied that it is not. Is it not a reproach that man is\\r\\na carnivorous animal? True, he can and does live, in a great measure, by\\r\\npreying on other animals; but this is a miserable way,—as any one who will\\r\\ngo to snaring rabbits, or slaughtering lambs, may learn,—and he will be\\r\\nregarded as a benefactor of his race who shall teach man to confine himself to\\r\\na more innocent and wholesome diet. Whatever my own practice may be, I have no\\r\\ndoubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual\\r\\nimprovement, to leave off eating animals, as surely as the savage tribes have\\r\\nleft off eating each other when they came in contact with the more civilized.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIf one listens to the faintest but constant suggestions of his genius, which\\r\\nare certainly true, he sees not to what extremes, or even insanity, it may lead\\r\\nhim; and yet that way, as he grows more resolute and faithful, his road lies.\\r\\nThe faintest assured objection which one healthy man feels will at length\\r\\nprevail over the arguments and customs of mankind. No man ever followed his\\r\\ngenius till it misled him. Though the result were bodily weakness, yet perhaps\\r\\nno one can say that the consequences were to be regretted, for these were a\\r\\nlife in conformity to higher principles. If the day and the night are such that\\r\\nyou greet them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and\\r\\nsweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal,—that is\\r\\nyour success. All nature is your congratulation, and you have cause momentarily\\r\\nto bless yourself. The greatest gains and values are farthest from being\\r\\nappreciated. We easily come to doubt if they exist. We soon forget them. They\\r\\nare the highest reality. Perhaps the facts most astounding and most real are\\r\\nnever communicated by man to man. The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat\\r\\nas intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning or evening. It is a\\r\\nlittle star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYet, for my part, I was never unusually squeamish; I could sometimes eat a\\r\\nfried rat with a good relish, if it were necessary. I am glad to have drunk\\r\\nwater so long, for the same reason that I prefer the natural sky to an\\r\\nopium-eater’s heaven. I would fain keep sober always; and there are\\r\\ninfinite degrees of drunkenness. I believe that water is the only drink for a\\r\\nwise man; wine is not so noble a liquor; and think of dashing the hopes of a\\r\\nmorning with a cup of warm coffee, or of an evening with a dish of tea! Ah, how\\r\\nlow I fall when I am tempted by them! Even music may be intoxicating. Such\\r\\napparently slight causes destroyed Greece and Rome, and will destroy England\\r\\nand America. Of all ebriosity, who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air\\r\\nhe breathes? I have found it to be the most serious objection to coarse labors\\r\\nlong continued, that they compelled me to eat and drink coarsely also. But to\\r\\ntell the truth, I find myself at present somewhat less particular in these\\r\\nrespects. I carry less religion to the table, ask no blessing; not because I am\\r\\nwiser than I was, but, I am obliged to confess, because, however much it is to\\r\\nbe regretted, with years I have grown more coarse and indifferent. Perhaps\\r\\nthese questions are entertained only in youth, as most believe of poetry. My\\r\\npractice is “nowhere,” my opinion is here. Nevertheless I am far\\r\\nfrom regarding myself as one of those privileged ones to whom the Ved refers\\r\\nwhen it says, that “he who has true faith in the Omnipresent Supreme\\r\\nBeing may eat all that exists,” that is, is not bound to inquire what is\\r\\nhis food, or who prepares it; and even in their case it is to be observed, as a\\r\\nHindoo commentator has remarked, that the Vedant limits this privilege to\\r\\n“the time of distress.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWho has not sometimes derived an inexpressible satisfaction from his food in\\r\\nwhich appetite had no share? I have been thrilled to think that I owed a mental\\r\\nperception to the commonly gross sense of taste, that I have been inspired\\r\\nthrough the palate, that some berries which I had eaten on a hill-side had fed\\r\\nmy genius. “The soul not being mistress of herself,” says\\r\\nThseng-tseu, “one looks, and one does not see; one listens, and one does\\r\\nnot hear; one eats, and one does not know the savor of food.” He who\\r\\ndistinguishes the true savor of his food can never be a glutton; he who does\\r\\nnot cannot be otherwise. A puritan may go to his brown-bread crust with as\\r\\ngross an appetite as ever an alderman to his turtle. Not that food which\\r\\nentereth into the mouth defileth a man, but the appetite with which it is\\r\\neaten. It is neither the quality nor the quantity, but the devotion to sensual\\r\\nsavors; when that which is eaten is not a viand to sustain our animal, or\\r\\ninspire our spiritual life, but food for the worms that possess us. If the\\r\\nhunter has a taste for mud-turtles, muskrats, and other such savage tid-bits,\\r\\nthe fine lady indulges a taste for jelly made of a calf’s foot, or for\\r\\nsardines from over the sea, and they are even. He goes to the mill-pond, she to\\r\\nher preserve-pot. The wonder is how they, how you and I, can live this slimy,\\r\\nbeastly life, eating and drinking.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur whole life is startlingly moral. There is never an instant’s truce\\r\\nbetween virtue and vice. Goodness is the only investment that never fails. In\\r\\nthe music of the harp which trembles round the world it is the insisting on\\r\\nthis which thrills us. The harp is the travelling patterer for the\\r\\nUniverse’s Insurance Company, recommending its laws, and our little\\r\\ngoodness is all the assessment that we pay. Though the youth at last grows\\r\\nindifferent, the laws of the universe are not indifferent, but are forever on\\r\\nthe side of the most sensitive. Listen to every zephyr for some reproof, for it\\r\\nis surely there, and he is unfortunate who does not hear it. We cannot touch a\\r\\nstring or move a stop but the charming moral transfixes us. Many an irksome\\r\\nnoise, go a long way off, is heard as music, a proud sweet satire on the\\r\\nmeanness of our lives.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWe are conscious of an animal in us, which awakens in proportion as our higher\\r\\nnature slumbers. It is reptile and sensual, and perhaps cannot be wholly\\r\\nexpelled; like the worms which, even in life and health, occupy our bodies.\\r\\nPossibly we may withdraw from it, but never change its nature. I fear that it\\r\\nmay enjoy a certain health of its own; that we may be well, yet not pure. The\\r\\nother day I picked up the lower jaw of a hog, with white and sound teeth and\\r\\ntusks, which suggested that there was an animal health and vigor distinct from\\r\\nthe spiritual. This creature succeeded by other means than temperance and\\r\\npurity. “That in which men differ from brute beasts,” says Mencius,\\r\\n“is a thing very inconsiderable; the common herd lose it very soon;\\r\\nsuperior men preserve it carefully.” Who knows what sort of life would\\r\\nresult if we had attained to purity? If I knew so wise a man as could teach me\\r\\npurity I would go to seek him forthwith. “A command over our passions,\\r\\nand over the external senses of the body, and good acts, are declared by the\\r\\nVed to be indispensable in the mind’s approximation to God.” Yet\\r\\nthe spirit can for the time pervade and control every member and function of\\r\\nthe body, and transmute what in form is the grossest sensuality into purity and\\r\\ndevotion. The generative energy, which, when we are loose, dissipates and makes\\r\\nus unclean, when we are continent invigorates and inspires us. Chastity is the\\r\\nflowering of man; and what are called Genius, Heroism, Holiness, and the like,\\r\\nare but various fruits which succeed it. Man flows at once to God when the\\r\\nchannel of purity is open. By turns our purity inspires and our impurity casts\\r\\nus down. He is blessed who is assured that the animal is dying out in him day\\r\\nby day, and the divine being established. Perhaps there is none but has cause\\r\\nfor shame on account of the inferior and brutish nature to which he is allied.\\r\\nI fear that we are such gods or demigods only as fauns and satyrs, the divine\\r\\nallied to beasts, the creatures of appetite, and that, to some extent, our very\\r\\nlife is our disgrace.—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How happy’s he who hath due place assigned\\r\\nTo his beasts and disafforested his mind!\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0*Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0*Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0*Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0*Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0*\\r\\n\\r\\nCan use this horse, goat, wolf, and ev’ry beast,\\r\\nAnd is not ass himself to all the rest!\\r\\nElse man not only is the herd of swine,\\r\\nBut he’s those devils too which did incline\\r\\nThem to a headlong rage, and made them worse.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAll sensuality is one, though it takes many forms; all purity is one. It is the\\r\\nsame whether a man eat, or drink, or cohabit, or sleep sensually. They are but\\r\\none appetite, and we only need to see a person do any one of these things to\\r\\nknow how great a sensualist he is. The impure can neither stand nor sit with\\r\\npurity. When the reptile is attacked at one mouth of his burrow, he shows\\r\\nhimself at another. If you would be chaste, you must be temperate. What is\\r\\nchastity? How shall a man know if he is chaste? He shall not know it. We have\\r\\nheard of this virtue, but we know not what it is. We speak conformably to the\\r\\nrumor which we have heard. From exertion come wisdom and purity; from sloth\\r\\nignorance and sensuality. In the student sensuality is a sluggish habit of\\r\\nmind. An unclean person is universally a slothful one, one who sits by a stove,\\r\\nwhom the sun shines on prostrate, who reposes without being fatigued. If you\\r\\nwould avoid uncleanness, and all the sins, work earnestly, though it be at\\r\\ncleaning a stable. Nature is hard to be overcome, but she must be overcome.\\r\\nWhat avails it that you are Christian, if you are not purer than the heathen,\\r\\nif you deny yourself no more, if you are not more religious? I know of many\\r\\nsystems of religion esteemed heathenish whose precepts fill the reader with\\r\\nshame, and provoke him to new endeavors, though it be to the performance of\\r\\nrites merely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI hesitate to say these things, but it is not because of the subject,—I\\r\\ncare not how obscene my words are,—but because I cannot speak of\\r\\nthem without betraying my impurity. We discourse freely without shame of one\\r\\nform of sensuality, and are silent about another. We are so degraded that we\\r\\ncannot speak simply of the necessary functions of human nature. In earlier\\r\\nages, in some countries, every function was reverently spoken of and regulated\\r\\nby law. Nothing was too trivial for the Hindoo lawgiver, however offensive it\\r\\nmay be to modern taste. He teaches how to eat, drink, cohabit, void excrement\\r\\nand urine, and the like, elevating what is mean, and does not falsely excuse\\r\\nhimself by calling these things trifles.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEvery man is the builder of a temple, called his body, to the god he worships,\\r\\nafter a style purely his own, nor can he get off by hammering marble instead.\\r\\nWe are all sculptors and painters, and our material is our own flesh and blood\\r\\nand bones. Any nobleness begins at once to refine a man’s features, any\\r\\nmeanness or sensuality to imbrute them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJohn Farmer sat at his door one September evening, after a hard day’s\\r\\nwork, his mind still running on his labor more or less. Having bathed, he sat\\r\\ndown to re-create his intellectual man. It was a rather cool evening, and some\\r\\nof his neighbors were apprehending a frost. He had not attended to the train of\\r\\nhis thoughts long when he heard some one playing on a flute, and that sound\\r\\nharmonized with his mood. Still he thought of his work; but the burden of his\\r\\nthought was, that though this kept running in his head, and he found himself\\r\\nplanning and contriving it against his will, yet it concerned him very little.\\r\\nIt was no more than the scurf of his skin, which was constantly shuffled off.\\r\\nBut the notes of the flute came home to his ears out of a different sphere from\\r\\nthat he worked in, and suggested work for certain faculties which slumbered in\\r\\nhim. They gently did away with the street, and the village, and the state in\\r\\nwhich he lived. A voice said to him,—Why do you stay here and live this\\r\\nmean moiling life, when a glorious existence is possible for you? Those same\\r\\nstars twinkle over other fields than these.—But how to come out of this\\r\\ncondition and actually migrate thither? All that he could think of was to\\r\\npractise some new austerity, to let his mind descend into his body and redeem\\r\\nit, and treat himself with ever increasing respect.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Brute Neighbors\\n\\r\\nSometimes I had a companion in my fishing, who came through the village to my\\r\\nhouse from the other side of the town, and the catching of the dinner was as\\r\\nmuch a social exercise as the eating of it.\\r\\n\\n\\nHermit. I wonder what the world is doing now. I have not heard so much\\r\\nas a locust over the sweet-fern these three hours. The pigeons are all asleep\\r\\nupon their roosts,—no flutter from them. Was that a farmer’s noon\\r\\nhorn which sounded from beyond the woods just now? The hands are coming in to\\r\\nboiled salt beef and cider and Indian bread. Why will men worry themselves so?\\r\\nHe that does not eat need not work. I wonder how much they have reaped. Who\\r\\nwould live there where a body can never think for the barking of Bose? And O,\\r\\nthe housekeeping! to keep bright the devil’s door-knobs, and scour his\\r\\ntubs this bright day! Better not keep a house. Say, some hollow tree; and then\\r\\nfor morning calls and dinner-parties! Only a woodpecker tapping. O, they\\r\\nswarm; the sun is too warm there; they are born too far into life for me. I\\r\\nhave water from the spring, and a loaf of brown bread on the shelf.—Hark!\\r\\nI hear a rustling of the leaves. Is it some ill-fed village hound yielding to\\r\\nthe instinct of the chase? or the lost pig which is said to be in these woods,\\r\\nwhose tracks I saw after the rain? It comes on apace; my sumachs and\\r\\nsweet-briers tremble.—Eh, Mr. Poet, is it you? How do you like the world\\r\\nto-day?\\r\\n\\n\\nPoet. See those clouds; how they hang! That’s the greatest thing I\\r\\nhave seen to-day. There’s nothing like it in old paintings, nothing like\\r\\nit in foreign lands,—unless when we were off the coast of Spain.\\r\\nThat’s a true Mediterranean sky. I thought, as I have my living to get,\\r\\nand have not eaten to-day, that I might go a-fishing. That’s the true\\r\\nindustry for poets. It is the only trade I have learned. Come, let’s\\r\\nalong.\\r\\n\\n\\nHermit. I cannot resist. My brown bread will soon be gone. I will go\\r\\nwith you gladly soon, but I am just concluding a serious meditation. I think\\r\\nthat I am near the end of it. Leave me alone, then, for a while. But that we\\r\\nmay not be delayed, you shall be digging the bait meanwhile. Angle-worms are\\r\\nrarely to be met with in these parts, where the soil was never fattened with\\r\\nmanure; the race is nearly extinct. The sport of digging the bait is nearly\\r\\nequal to that of catching the fish, when one’s appetite is not too keen;\\r\\nand this you may have all to yourself to-day. I would advise you to set in the\\r\\nspade down yonder among the ground-nuts, where you see the johnswort waving. I\\r\\nthink that I may warrant you one worm to every three sods you turn up, if you\\r\\nlook well in among the roots of the grass, as if you were weeding. Or, if you\\r\\nchoose to go farther, it will not be unwise, for I have found the increase of\\r\\nfair bait to be very nearly as the squares of the distances.\\r\\n\\n\\nHermit alone. Let me see; where was I? Methinks I was nearly in this\\r\\nframe of mind; the world lay about at this angle. Shall I go to heaven or\\r\\na-fishing? If I should soon bring this meditation to an end, would another so\\r\\nsweet occasion be likely to offer? I was as near being resolved into the\\r\\nessence of things as ever I was in my life. I fear my thoughts will not come\\r\\nback to me. If it would do any good, I would whistle for them. When they make\\r\\nus an offer, is it wise to say, We will think of it? My thoughts have left no\\r\\ntrack, and I cannot find the path again. What was it that I was thinking of? It\\r\\nwas a very hazy day. I will just try these three sentences of Con-fut-see; they\\r\\nmay fetch that state about again. I know not whether it was the dumps or a\\r\\nbudding ecstasy. Mem. There never is but one opportunity of a kind.\\r\\n\\n\\nPoet. How now, Hermit, is it too soon? I have got just thirteen whole\\r\\nones, beside several which are imperfect or undersized; but they will do for\\r\\nthe smaller fry; they do not cover up the hook so much. Those village worms are\\r\\nquite too large; a shiner may make a meal off one without finding the skewer.\\r\\n\\n\\nHermit. Well, then, let’s be off. Shall we to the Concord?\\r\\nThere’s good sport there if the water be not too high.\\n\\n\\r\\nWhy do precisely these objects which we behold make a world? Why has man just\\r\\nthese species of animals for his neighbors; as if nothing but a mouse could\\r\\nhave filled this crevice? I suspect that Pilpay & Co. have put animals to\\r\\ntheir best use, for they are all beasts of burden, in a sense, made to carry\\r\\nsome portion of our thoughts.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe mice which haunted my house were not the common ones, which are said to\\r\\nhave been introduced into the country, but a wild native kind not found in the\\r\\nvillage. I sent one to a distinguished naturalist, and it interested him much.\\r\\nWhen I was building, one of these had its nest underneath the house, and before\\r\\nI had laid the second floor, and swept out the shavings, would come out\\r\\nregularly at lunch time and pick up the crumbs at my feet. It probably had\\r\\nnever seen a man before; and it soon became quite familiar, and would run over\\r\\nmy shoes and up my clothes. It could readily ascend the sides of the room by\\r\\nshort impulses, like a squirrel, which it resembled in its motions. At length,\\r\\nas I leaned with my elbow on the bench one day, it ran up my clothes, and along\\r\\nmy sleeve, and round and round the paper which held my dinner, while I kept the\\r\\nlatter close, and dodged and played at bopeep with it; and when at last I held\\r\\nstill a piece of cheese between my thumb and finger, it came and nibbled it,\\r\\nsitting in my hand, and afterward cleaned its face and paws, like a fly, and\\r\\nwalked away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA phÅ\\x93be soon built in my shed, and a robin for protection in a pine which\\r\\ngrew against the house. In June the partridge (Tetrao umbellus,) which\\r\\nis so shy a bird, led her brood past my windows, from the woods in the rear to\\r\\nthe front of my house, clucking and calling to them like a hen, and in all her\\r\\nbehavior proving herself the hen of the woods. The young suddenly disperse on\\r\\nyour approach, at a signal from the mother, as if a whirlwind had swept them\\r\\naway, and they so exactly resemble the dried leaves and twigs that many a\\r\\ntraveler has placed his foot in the midst of a brood, and heard the whir of the\\r\\nold bird as she flew off, and her anxious calls and mewing, or seen her trail\\r\\nher wings to attract his attention, without suspecting their neighborhood. The\\r\\nparent will sometimes roll and spin round before you in such a dishabille, that\\r\\nyou cannot, for a few moments, detect what kind of creature it is. The young\\r\\nsquat still and flat, often running their heads under a leaf, and mind only\\r\\ntheir mother’s directions given from a distance, nor will your approach\\r\\nmake them run again and betray themselves. You may even tread on them, or have\\r\\nyour eyes on them for a minute, without discovering them. I have held them in\\r\\nmy open hand at such a time, and still their only care, obedient to their\\r\\nmother and their instinct, was to squat there without fear or trembling. So\\r\\nperfect is this instinct, that once, when I had laid them on the leaves again,\\r\\nand one accidentally fell on its side, it was found with the rest in exactly\\r\\nthe same position ten minutes afterward. They are not callow like the young of\\r\\nmost birds, but more perfectly developed and precocious even than chickens. The\\r\\nremarkably adult yet innocent expression of their open and serene eyes is very\\r\\nmemorable. All intelligence seems reflected in them. They suggest not merely\\r\\nthe purity of infancy, but a wisdom clarified by experience. Such an eye was\\r\\nnot born when the bird was, but is coeval with the sky it reflects. The woods\\r\\ndo not yield another such a gem. The traveller does not often look into such a\\r\\nlimpid well. The ignorant or reckless sportsman often shoots the parent at such\\r\\na time, and leaves these innocents to fall a prey to some prowling beast or\\r\\nbird, or gradually mingle with the decaying leaves which they so much resemble.\\r\\nIt is said that when hatched by a hen they will directly disperse on some\\r\\nalarm, and so are lost, for they never hear the mother’s call which\\r\\ngathers them again. These were my hens and chickens.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is remarkable how many creatures live wild and free though secret in the\\r\\nwoods, and still sustain themselves in the neighborhood of towns, suspected by\\r\\nhunters only. How retired the otter manages to live here! He grows to be four\\r\\nfeet long, as big as a small boy, perhaps without any human being getting a\\r\\nglimpse of him. I formerly saw the raccoon in the woods behind where my house\\r\\nis built, and probably still heard their whinnering at night. Commonly I rested\\r\\nan hour or two in the shade at noon, after planting, and ate my lunch, and read\\r\\na little by a spring which was the source of a swamp and of a brook, oozing\\r\\nfrom under Brister’s Hill, half a mile from my field. The approach to\\r\\nthis was through a succession of descending grassy hollows, full of young\\r\\npitch-pines, into a larger wood about the swamp. There, in a very secluded and\\r\\nshaded spot, under a spreading white-pine, there was yet a clean, firm sward to\\r\\nsit on. I had dug out the spring and made a well of clear gray water, where I\\r\\ncould dip up a pailful without roiling it, and thither I went for this purpose\\r\\nalmost every day in midsummer, when the pond was warmest. Thither, too, the\\r\\nwood-cock led her brood, to probe the mud for worms, flying but a foot above\\r\\nthem down the bank, while they ran in a troop beneath; but at last, spying me,\\r\\nshe would leave her young and circle round and round me, nearer and nearer till\\r\\nwithin four or five feet, pretending broken wings and legs, to attract my\\r\\nattention, and get off her young, who would already have taken up their march,\\r\\nwith faint wiry peep, single file through the swamp, as she directed. Or I\\r\\nheard the peep of the young when I could not see the parent bird. There too the\\r\\nturtle-doves sat over the spring, or fluttered from bough to bough of the soft\\r\\nwhite-pines over my head; or the red squirrel, coursing down the nearest bough,\\r\\nwas particularly familiar and inquisitive. You only need sit still long enough\\r\\nin some attractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit\\r\\nthemselves to you by turns.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI was witness to events of a less peaceful character. One day when I went out\\r\\nto my wood-pile, or rather my pile of stumps, I observed two large ants, the\\r\\none red, the other much larger, nearly half an inch long, and black, fiercely\\r\\ncontending with one another. Having once got hold they never let go, but\\r\\nstruggled and wrestled and rolled on the chips incessantly. Looking farther, I\\r\\nwas surprised to find that the chips were covered with such combatants, that it\\r\\nwas not a duellum, but a bellum, a war between two races of ants,\\r\\nthe red always pitted against the black, and frequently two red ones to one\\r\\nblack. The legions of these Myrmidons covered all the hills and vales in my\\r\\nwood-yard, and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dying, both red\\r\\nand black. It was the only battle which I have ever witnessed, the only\\r\\nbattle-field I ever trod while the battle was raging; internecine war; the red\\r\\nrepublicans on the one hand, and the black imperialists on the other. On every\\r\\nside they were engaged in deadly combat, yet without any noise that I could\\r\\nhear, and human soldiers never fought so resolutely. I watched a couple that\\r\\nwere fast locked in each other’s embraces, in a little sunny valley amid\\r\\nthe chips, now at noon-day prepared to fight till the sun went down, or life\\r\\nwent out. The smaller red champion had fastened himself like a vice to his\\r\\nadversary’s front, and through all the tumblings on that field never for\\r\\nan instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the root, having already\\r\\ncaused the other to go by the board; while the stronger black one dashed him\\r\\nfrom side to side, and, as I saw on looking nearer, had already divested him of\\r\\nseveral of his members. They fought with more pertinacity than bull-dogs.\\r\\nNeither manifested the least disposition to retreat. It was evident that their\\r\\nbattle-cry was Conquer or die. In the mean while there came along a single red\\r\\nant on the hill-side of this valley, evidently full of excitement, who either\\r\\nhad despatched his foe, or had not yet taken part in the battle; probably the\\r\\nlatter, for he had lost none of his limbs; whose mother had charged him to\\r\\nreturn with his shield or upon it. Or perchance he was some Achilles, who had\\r\\nnourished his wrath apart, and had now come to avenge or rescue his Patroclus.\\r\\nHe saw this unequal combat from afar,—for the blacks were nearly twice\\r\\nthe size of the red,—he drew near with rapid pace till he stood on his\\r\\nguard within half an inch of the combatants; then, watching his opportunity, he\\r\\nsprang upon the black warrior, and commenced his operations near the root of\\r\\nhis right fore-leg, leaving the foe to select among his own members; and so\\r\\nthere were three united for life, as if a new kind of attraction had been\\r\\ninvented which put all other locks and cements to shame. I should not have\\r\\nwondered by this time to find that they had their respective musical bands\\r\\nstationed on some eminent chip, and playing their national airs the while, to\\r\\nexcite the slow and cheer the dying combatants. I was myself excited somewhat\\r\\neven as if they had been men. The more you think of it, the less the\\r\\ndifference. And certainly there is not the fight recorded in Concord history,\\r\\nat least, if in the history of America, that will bear a moment’s\\r\\ncomparison with this, whether for the numbers engaged in it, or for the\\r\\npatriotism and heroism displayed. For numbers and for carnage it was an\\r\\nAusterlitz or Dresden. Concord Fight! Two killed on the patriots’ side,\\r\\nand Luther Blanchard wounded! Why here every ant was a\\r\\nButtrick,—“Fire! for God’s sake fire!”—and\\r\\nthousands shared the fate of Davis and Hosmer. There was not one hireling\\r\\nthere. I have no doubt that it was a principle they fought for, as much as our\\r\\nancestors, and not to avoid a three-penny tax on their tea; and the results of\\r\\nthis battle will be as important and memorable to those whom it concerns as\\r\\nthose of the battle of Bunker Hill, at least.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI took up the chip on which the three I have particularly described were\\r\\nstruggling, carried it into my house, and placed it under a tumbler on my\\r\\nwindow-sill, in order to see the issue. Holding a microscope to the\\r\\nfirst-mentioned red ant, I saw that, though he was assiduously gnawing at the\\r\\nnear fore-leg of his enemy, having severed his remaining feeler, his own breast\\r\\nwas all torn away, exposing what vitals he had there to the jaws of the black\\r\\nwarrior, whose breastplate was apparently too thick for him to pierce; and the\\r\\ndark carbuncles of the sufferer’s eyes shone with ferocity such as war\\r\\nonly could excite. They struggled half an hour longer under the tumbler, and\\r\\nwhen I looked again the black soldier had severed the heads of his foes from\\r\\ntheir bodies, and the still living heads were hanging on either side of him\\r\\nlike ghastly trophies at his saddle-bow, still apparently as firmly fastened as\\r\\never, and he was endeavoring with feeble struggles, being without feelers and\\r\\nwith only the remnant of a leg, and I know not how many other wounds, to divest\\r\\nhimself of them; which at length, after half an hour more, he accomplished. I\\r\\nraised the glass, and he went off over the window-sill in that crippled state.\\r\\nWhether he finally survived that combat, and spent the remainder of his days in\\r\\nsome Hotel des Invalides, I do not know; but I thought that his industry would\\r\\nnot be worth much thereafter. I never learned which party was victorious, nor\\r\\nthe cause of the war; but I felt for the rest of that day as if I had had my\\r\\nfeelings excited and harrowed by witnessing the struggle, the ferocity and\\r\\ncarnage, of a human battle before my door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nKirby and Spence tell us that the battles of ants have long been celebrated and\\r\\nthe date of them recorded, though they say that Huber is the only modern author\\r\\nwho appears to have witnessed them. “Ã\\x86neas Sylvius,” say they,\\r\\n“after giving a very circumstantial account of one contested with great\\r\\nobstinacy by a great and small species on the trunk of a pear tree,” adds\\r\\nthat “‘This action was fought in the pontificate of Eugenius the\\r\\nFourth, in the presence of Nicholas Pistoriensis, an eminent lawyer, who\\r\\nrelated the whole history of the battle with the greatest fidelity.’ A\\r\\nsimilar engagement between great and small ants is recorded by Olaus Magnus, in\\r\\nwhich the small ones, being victorious, are said to have buried the bodies of\\r\\ntheir own soldiers, but left those of their giant enemies a prey to the birds.\\r\\nThis event happened previous to the expulsion of the tyrant Christiern the\\r\\nSecond from Sweden.” The battle which I witnessed took place in the\\r\\nPresidency of Polk, five years before the passage of Webster’s\\r\\nFugitive-Slave Bill.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMany a village Bose, fit only to course a mud-turtle in a victualling cellar,\\r\\nsported his heavy quarters in the woods, without the knowledge of his master,\\r\\nand ineffectually smelled at old fox burrows and woodchucks’ holes; led\\r\\nperchance by some slight cur which nimbly threaded the wood, and might still\\r\\ninspire a natural terror in its denizens;—now far behind his guide,\\r\\nbarking like a canine bull toward some small squirrel which had treed itself\\r\\nfor scrutiny, then, cantering off, bending the bushes with his weight,\\r\\nimagining that he is on the track of some stray member of the jerbilla family.\\r\\nOnce I was surprised to see a cat walking along the stony shore of the pond,\\r\\nfor they rarely wander so far from home. The surprise was mutual. Nevertheless\\r\\nthe most domestic cat, which has lain on a rug all her days, appears quite at\\r\\nhome in the woods, and, by her sly and stealthy behavior, proves herself more\\r\\nnative there than the regular inhabitants. Once, when berrying, I met with a\\r\\ncat with young kittens in the woods, quite wild, and they all, like their\\r\\nmother, had their backs up and were fiercely spitting at me. A few years before\\r\\nI lived in the woods there was what was called a “winged cat” in\\r\\none of the farm-houses in Lincoln nearest the pond, Mr. Gilian Baker’s.\\r\\nWhen I called to see her in June, 1842, she was gone a-hunting in the woods, as\\r\\nwas her wont, (I am not sure whether it was a male or female, and so use the\\r\\nmore common pronoun,) but her mistress told me that she came into the\\r\\nneighborhood a little more than a year before, in April, and was finally taken\\r\\ninto their house; that she was of a dark brownish-gray color, with a white spot\\r\\non her throat, and white feet, and had a large bushy tail like a fox; that in\\r\\nthe winter the fur grew thick and flatted out along her sides, forming stripes\\r\\nten or twelve inches long by two and a half wide, and under her chin like a\\r\\nmuff, the upper side loose, the under matted like felt, and in the spring these\\r\\nappendages dropped off. They gave me a pair of her “wings,” which I\\r\\nkeep still. There is no appearance of a membrane about them. Some thought it\\r\\nwas part flying-squirrel or some other wild animal, which is not impossible,\\r\\nfor, according to naturalists, prolific hybrids have been produced by the union\\r\\nof the marten and domestic cat. This would have been the right kind of cat for\\r\\nme to keep, if I had kept any; for why should not a poet’s cat be winged\\r\\nas well as his horse?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the fall the loon (Colymbus glacialis) came, as usual, to moult and\\r\\nbathe in the pond, making the woods ring with his wild laughter before I had\\r\\nrisen. At rumor of his arrival all the Mill-dam sportsmen are on the alert, in\\r\\ngigs and on foot, two by two and three by three, with patent rifles and conical\\r\\nballs and spy-glasses. They come rustling through the woods like autumn leaves,\\r\\nat least ten men to one loon. Some station themselves on this side of the pond,\\r\\nsome on that, for the poor bird cannot be omnipresent; if he dive here he must\\r\\ncome up there. But now the kind October wind rises, rustling the leaves and\\r\\nrippling the surface of the water, so that no loon can be heard or seen, though\\r\\nhis foes sweep the pond with spy-glasses, and make the woods resound with their\\r\\ndischarges. The waves generously rise and dash angrily, taking sides with all\\r\\nwater-fowl, and our sportsmen must beat a retreat to town and shop and\\r\\nunfinished jobs. But they were too often successful. When I went to get a pail\\r\\nof water early in the morning I frequently saw this stately bird sailing out of\\r\\nmy cove within a few rods. If I endeavored to overtake him in a boat, in order\\r\\nto see how he would manÅ\\x93uvre, he would dive and be completely lost, so that I\\r\\ndid not discover him again, sometimes, till the latter part of the day. But I\\r\\nwas more than a match for him on the surface. He commonly went off in a rain.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I was paddling along the north shore one very calm October afternoon, for\\r\\nsuch days especially they settle on to the lakes, like the milkweed down,\\r\\nhaving looked in vain over the pond for a loon, suddenly one, sailing out from\\r\\nthe shore toward the middle a few rods in front of me, set up his wild laugh\\r\\nand betrayed himself. I pursued with a paddle and he dived, but when he came up\\r\\nI was nearer than before. He dived again, but I miscalculated the direction he\\r\\nwould take, and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface this time,\\r\\nfor I had helped to widen the interval; and again he laughed long and loud, and\\r\\nwith more reason than before. He manÅ\\x93uvred so cunningly that I could not get\\r\\nwithin half a dozen rods of him. Each time, when he came to the surface,\\r\\nturning his head this way and that, he cooly surveyed the water and the land,\\r\\nand apparently chose his course so that he might come up where there was the\\r\\nwidest expanse of water and at the greatest distance from the boat. It was\\r\\nsurprising how quickly he made up his mind and put his resolve into execution.\\r\\nHe led me at once to the widest part of the pond, and could not be driven from\\r\\nit. While he was thinking one thing in his brain, I was endeavoring to divine\\r\\nhis thought in mine. It was a pretty game, played on the smooth surface of the\\r\\npond, a man against a loon. Suddenly your adversary’s checker disappears\\r\\nbeneath the board, and the problem is to place yours nearest to where his will\\r\\nappear again. Sometimes he would come up unexpectedly on the opposite side of\\r\\nme, having apparently passed directly under the boat. So long-winded was he and\\r\\nso unweariable, that when he had swum farthest he would immediately plunge\\r\\nagain, nevertheless; and then no wit could divine where in the deep pond,\\r\\nbeneath the smooth surface, he might be speeding his way like a fish, for he\\r\\nhad time and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in its deepest part. It is\\r\\nsaid that loons have been caught in the New York lakes eighty feet beneath the\\r\\nsurface, with hooks set for trout,—though Walden is deeper than that. How\\r\\nsurprised must the fishes be to see this ungainly visitor from another sphere\\r\\nspeeding his way amid their schools! Yet he appeared to know his course as\\r\\nsurely under water as on the surface, and swam much faster there. Once or twice\\r\\nI saw a ripple where he approached the surface, just put his head out to\\r\\nreconnoitre, and instantly dived again. I found that it was as well for me to\\r\\nrest on my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where he\\r\\nwould rise; for again and again, when I was straining my eyes over the surface\\r\\none way, I would suddenly be startled by his unearthly laugh behind me. But\\r\\nwhy, after displaying so much cunning, did he invariably betray himself the\\r\\nmoment he came up by that loud laugh? Did not his white breast enough betray\\r\\nhim? He was indeed a silly loon, I thought. I could commonly hear the splash of\\r\\nthe water when he came up, and so also detected him. But after an hour he\\r\\nseemed as fresh as ever, dived as willingly and swam yet farther than at first.\\r\\nIt was surprising to see how serenely he sailed off with unruffled breast when\\r\\nhe came to the surface, doing all the work with his webbed feet beneath. His\\r\\nusual note was this demoniac laughter, yet somewhat like that of a water-fowl;\\r\\nbut occasionally, when he had balked me most successfully and come up a long\\r\\nway off, he uttered a long-drawn unearthly howl, probably more like that of a\\r\\nwolf than any bird; as when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and\\r\\ndeliberately howls. This was his looning,—perhaps the wildest sound that\\r\\nis ever heard here, making the woods ring far and wide. I concluded that he\\r\\nlaughed in derision of my efforts, confident of his own resources. Though the\\r\\nsky was by this time overcast, the pond was so smooth that I could see where he\\r\\nbroke the surface when I did not hear him. His white breast, the stillness of\\r\\nthe air, and the smoothness of the water were all against him. At length,\\r\\nhaving come up fifty rods off, he uttered one of those prolonged howls, as if\\r\\ncalling on the god of loons to aid him, and immediately there came a wind from\\r\\nthe east and rippled the surface, and filled the whole air with misty rain, and\\r\\nI was impressed as if it were the prayer of the loon answered, and his god was\\r\\nangry with me; and so I left him disappearing far away on the tumultuous\\r\\nsurface.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor hours, in fall days, I watched the ducks cunningly tack and veer and hold\\r\\nthe middle of the pond, far from the sportsman; tricks which they will have\\r\\nless need to practise in Louisiana bayous. When compelled to rise they would\\r\\nsometimes circle round and round and over the pond at a considerable height,\\r\\nfrom which they could easily see to other ponds and the river, like black motes\\r\\nin the sky; and, when I thought they had gone off thither long since, they\\r\\nwould settle down by a slanting flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant\\r\\npart which was left free; but what beside safety they got by sailing in the\\r\\nmiddle of Walden I do not know, unless they love its water for the same reason\\r\\nthat I do.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n House-Warming\\n\\r\\nIn October I went a-graping to the river meadows, and loaded myself with\\r\\nclusters more precious for their beauty and fragrance than for food. There\\r\\ntoo I admired, though I did not gather, the cranberries, small waxen gems,\\r\\npendants of the meadow grass, pearly and red, which the farmer plucks with an\\r\\nugly rake, leaving the smooth meadow in a snarl, heedlessly measuring them by\\r\\nthe bushel and the dollar only, and sells the spoils of the meads to Boston and\\r\\nNew York; destined to be jammed, to satisfy the tastes of lovers of\\r\\nNature there. So butchers rake the tongues of bison out of the prairie grass,\\r\\nregardless of the torn and drooping plant. The barberry’s brilliant fruit\\r\\nwas likewise food for my eyes merely; but I collected a small store of wild\\r\\napples for coddling, which the proprietor and travellers had overlooked. When\\r\\nchestnuts were ripe I laid up half a bushel for winter. It was very exciting at\\r\\nthat season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of Lincoln,—they now\\r\\nsleep their long sleep under the railroad,—with a bag on my shoulder, and\\r\\na stick to open burrs with in my hand, for I did not always wait for the frost,\\r\\namid the rustling of leaves and the loud reproofs of the red-squirrels and the\\r\\njays, whose half-consumed nuts I sometimes stole, for the burrs which they had\\r\\nselected were sure to contain sound ones. Occasionally I climbed and shook the\\r\\ntrees. They grew also behind my house, and one large tree, which almost\\r\\novershadowed it, was, when in flower, a bouquet which scented the whole\\r\\nneighborhood, but the squirrels and the jays got most of its fruit; the last\\r\\ncoming in flocks early in the morning and picking the nuts out of the burrs\\r\\nbefore they fell. I relinquished these trees to them and visited the more\\r\\ndistant woods composed wholly of chestnut. These nuts, as far as they went,\\r\\nwere a good substitute for bread. Many other substitutes might, perhaps, be\\r\\nfound. Digging one day for fish-worms, I discovered the ground-nut (Apios\\r\\ntuberosa) on its string, the potato of the aborigines, a sort of fabulous\\r\\nfruit, which I had begun to doubt if I had ever dug and eaten in childhood, as\\r\\nI had told, and had not dreamed it. I had often since seen its crimpled red\\r\\nvelvety blossom supported by the stems of other plants without knowing it to be\\r\\nthe same. Cultivation has well nigh exterminated it. It has a sweetish taste,\\r\\nmuch like that of a frostbitten potato, and I found it better boiled than\\r\\nroasted. This tuber seemed like a faint promise of Nature to rear her own\\r\\nchildren and feed them simply here at some future period. In these days of\\r\\nfatted cattle and waving grain-fields this humble root, which was once the\\r\\ntotem of an Indian tribe, is quite forgotten, or known only by its\\r\\nflowering vine; but let wild Nature reign here once more, and the tender and\\r\\nluxurious English grains will probably disappear before a myriad of foes, and\\r\\nwithout the care of man the crow may carry back even the last seed of corn to\\r\\nthe great cornfield of the Indian’s God in the south-west, whence he is\\r\\nsaid to have brought it; but the now almost exterminated ground-nut will\\r\\nperhaps revive and flourish in spite of frosts and wildness, prove itself\\r\\nindigenous, and resume its ancient importance and dignity as the diet of the\\r\\nhunter tribe. Some Indian Ceres or Minerva must have been the inventor and\\r\\nbestower of it; and when the reign of poetry commences here, its leaves and\\r\\nstring of nuts may be represented on our works of art.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAlready, by the first of September, I had seen two or three small maples turned\\r\\nscarlet across the pond, beneath where the white stems of three aspens\\r\\ndiverged, at the point of a promontory, next the water. Ah, many a tale their\\r\\ncolor told! And gradually from week to week the character of each tree came\\r\\nout, and it admired itself reflected in the smooth mirror of the lake. Each\\r\\nmorning the manager of this gallery substituted some new picture, distinguished\\r\\nby more brilliant or harmonious coloring, for the old upon the walls.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe wasps came by thousands to my lodge in October, as to winter quarters, and\\r\\nsettled on my windows within and on the walls over-head, sometimes deterring\\r\\nvisitors from entering. Each morning, when they were numbed with cold, I swept\\r\\nsome of them out, but I did not trouble myself much to get rid of them; I even\\r\\nfelt complimented by their regarding my house as a desirable shelter. They\\r\\nnever molested me seriously, though they bedded with me; and they gradually\\r\\ndisappeared, into what crevices I do not know, avoiding winter and unspeakable\\r\\ncold.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLike the wasps, before I finally went into winter quarters in November, I used\\r\\nto resort to the north-east side of Walden, which the sun, reflected from the\\r\\npitch-pine woods and the stony shore, made the fire-side of the pond; it is so\\r\\nmuch pleasanter and wholesomer to be warmed by the sun while you can be, than\\r\\nby an artificial fire. I thus warmed myself by the still glowing embers which\\r\\nthe summer, like a departed hunter, had left.\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I came to build my chimney I studied masonry. My bricks being second-hand\\r\\nones required to be cleaned with a trowel, so that I learned more than usual\\r\\nof the qualities of bricks and trowels. The mortar on them was fifty years old,\\r\\nand was said to be still growing harder; but this is one of those sayings which\\r\\nmen love to repeat whether they are true or not. Such sayings themselves grow\\r\\nharder and adhere more firmly with age, and it would take many blows with a\\r\\ntrowel to clean an old wiseacre of them. Many of the villages of Mesopotamia\\r\\nare built of second-hand bricks of a very good quality, obtained from the ruins\\r\\nof Babylon, and the cement on them is older and probably harder still. However\\r\\nthat may be, I was struck by the peculiar toughness of the steel which bore so\\r\\nmany violent blows without being worn out. As my bricks had been in a chimney\\r\\nbefore, though I did not read the name of Nebuchadnezzar on them, I picked out\\r\\nas many fire-place bricks as I could find, to save work and waste, and I filled\\r\\nthe spaces between the bricks about the fire-place with stones from the pond\\r\\nshore, and also made my mortar with the white sand from the same place. I\\r\\nlingered most about the fireplace, as the most vital part of the house. Indeed,\\r\\nI worked so deliberately, that though I commenced at the ground in the morning,\\r\\na course of bricks raised a few inches above the floor served for my pillow at\\r\\nnight; yet I did not get a stiff neck for it that I remember; my stiff neck is\\r\\nof older date. I took a poet to board for a fortnight about those times, which\\r\\ncaused me to be put to it for room. He brought his own knife, though I had two,\\r\\nand we used to scour them by thrusting them into the earth. He shared with me\\r\\nthe labors of cooking. I was pleased to see my work rising so square and solid\\r\\nby degrees, and reflected, that, if it proceeded slowly, it was calculated to\\r\\nendure a long time. The chimney is to some extent an independent structure,\\r\\nstanding on the ground and rising through the house to the heavens; even after\\r\\nthe house is burned it still stands sometimes, and its importance and\\r\\nindependence are apparent. This was toward the end of summer. It was now\\r\\nNovember.\\n\\n\\r\\nThe north wind had already begun to cool the pond, though it took many weeks of\\r\\nsteady blowing to accomplish it, it is so deep. When I began to have a fire at\\r\\nevening, before I plastered my house, the chimney carried smoke particularly\\r\\nwell, because of the numerous chinks between the boards. Yet I passed some\\r\\ncheerful evenings in that cool and airy apartment, surrounded by the rough\\r\\nbrown boards full of knots, and rafters with the bark on high overhead. My\\r\\nhouse never pleased my eye so much after it was plastered, though I was obliged\\r\\nto confess that it was more comfortable. Should not every apartment in which\\r\\nman dwells be lofty enough to create some obscurity over-head, where flickering\\r\\nshadows may play at evening about the rafters? These forms are more agreeable\\r\\nto the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or other the most expensive\\r\\nfurniture. I now first began to inhabit my house, I may say, when I began to\\r\\nuse it for warmth as well as shelter. I had got a couple of old fire-dogs to\\r\\nkeep the wood from the hearth, and it did me good to see the soot form on the\\r\\nback of the chimney which I had built, and I poked the fire with more right and\\r\\nmore satisfaction than usual. My dwelling was small, and I could hardly\\r\\nentertain an echo in it; but it seemed larger for being a single apartment and\\r\\nremote from neighbors. All the attractions of a house were concentrated in one\\r\\nroom; it was kitchen, chamber, parlor, and keeping-room; and whatever\\r\\nsatisfaction parent or child, master or servant, derive from living in a house,\\r\\nI enjoyed it all. Cato says, the master of a family (patremfamilias)\\r\\nmust have in his rustic villa “cellam oleariam, vinariam, dolia multa,\\r\\nuti lubeat caritatem expectare, et rei, et virtuti, et gloriÃ¦ erit,”\\r\\nthat is, “an oil and wine cellar, many casks, so that it may be pleasant\\r\\nto expect hard times; it will be for his advantage, and virtue, and\\r\\nglory.” I had in my cellar a firkin of potatoes, about two quarts of peas\\r\\nwith the weevil in them, and on my shelf a little rice, a jug of molasses, and\\r\\nof rye and Indian meal a peck each.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI sometimes dream of a larger and more populous house, standing in a golden\\r\\nage, of enduring materials, and without ginger-bread work, which shall still\\r\\nconsist of only one room, a vast, rude, substantial, primitive hall, without\\r\\nceiling or plastering, with bare rafters and purlins supporting a sort of lower\\r\\nheaven over one’s head,—useful to keep off rain and snow; where the\\r\\nking and queen posts stand out to receive your homage, when you have done\\r\\nreverence to the prostrate Saturn of an older dynasty on stepping over the\\r\\nsill; a cavernous house, wherein you must reach up a torch upon a pole to see\\r\\nthe roof; where some may live in the fire-place, some in the recess of a window,\\r\\nand some on settles, some at one end of the hall, some at another, and some\\r\\naloft on rafters with the spiders, if they choose; a house which you have got\\r\\ninto when you have opened the outside door, and the ceremony is over; where the\\r\\nweary traveller may wash, and eat, and converse, and sleep, without further\\r\\njourney; such a shelter as you would be glad to reach in a tempestuous night,\\r\\ncontaining all the essentials of a house, and nothing for house-keeping; where\\r\\nyou can see all the treasures of the house at one view, and every thing hangs\\r\\nupon its peg, that a man should use; at once kitchen, pantry, parlor, chamber,\\r\\nstore-house, and garret; where you can see so necessary a thing as a barrel or\\r\\na ladder, so convenient a thing as a cupboard, and hear the pot boil, and pay\\r\\nyour respects to the fire that cooks your dinner and the oven that bakes your\\r\\nbread, and the necessary furniture and utensils are the chief ornaments; where\\r\\nthe washing is not put out, nor the fire, nor the mistress, and perhaps you are\\r\\nsometimes requested to move from off the trap-door, when the cook would descend\\r\\ninto the cellar, and so learn whether the ground is solid or hollow beneath you\\r\\nwithout stamping. A house whose inside is as open and manifest as a\\r\\nbird’s nest, and you cannot go in at the front door and out at the back\\r\\nwithout seeing some of its inhabitants; where to be a guest is to be presented\\r\\nwith the freedom of the house, and not to be carefully excluded from seven\\r\\neighths of it, shut up in a particular cell, and told to make yourself at home\\r\\nthere,—in solitary confinement. Nowadays the host does not admit you to\\r\\nhis hearth, but has got the mason to build one for yourself somewhere in\\r\\nhis alley, and hospitality is the art of keeping you at the greatest\\r\\ndistance. There is as much secrecy about the cooking as if he had a design to\\r\\npoison you. I am aware that I have been on many a man’s premises, and\\r\\nmight have been legally ordered off, but I am not aware that I have been in\\r\\nmany men’s houses. I might visit in my old clothes a king and queen who\\r\\nlived simply in such a house as I have described, if I were going their way;\\r\\nbut backing out of a modern palace will be all that I shall desire to learn, if\\r\\never I am caught in one.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt would seem as if the very language of our parlors would lose all its nerve\\r\\nand degenerate into palaver wholly, our lives pass at such remoteness\\r\\nfrom its symbols, and its metaphors and tropes are necessarily so far fetched,\\r\\nthrough slides and dumb-waiters, as it were; in other words, the parlor is so\\r\\nfar from the kitchen and workshop. The dinner even is only the parable of a\\r\\ndinner, commonly. As if only the savage dwelt near enough to Nature and Truth\\r\\nto borrow a trope from them. How can the scholar, who dwells away in the North\\r\\nWest Territory or the Isle of Man, tell what is parliamentary in the kitchen?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHowever, only one or two of my guests were ever bold enough to stay and eat a\\r\\nhasty-pudding with me; but when they saw that crisis approaching they beat a\\r\\nhasty retreat rather, as if it would shake the house to its foundations.\\r\\nNevertheless, it stood through a great many hasty-puddings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI did not plaster till it was freezing weather. I brought over some whiter and\\r\\ncleaner sand for this purpose from the opposite shore of the pond in a boat, a\\r\\nsort of conveyance which would have tempted me to go much farther if necessary.\\r\\nMy house had in the mean while been shingled down to the ground on every side.\\r\\nIn lathing I was pleased to be able to send home each nail with a single blow\\r\\nof the hammer, and it was my ambition to transfer the plaster from the board to\\r\\nthe wall neatly and rapidly. I remembered the story of a conceited fellow, who,\\r\\nin fine clothes, was wont to lounge about the village once, giving advice to\\r\\nworkmen. Venturing one day to substitute deeds for words, he turned up his\\r\\ncuffs, seized a plasterer’s board, and having loaded his trowel without\\r\\nmishap, with a complacent look toward the lathing overhead, made a bold gesture\\r\\nthitherward; and straightway, to his complete discomfiture, received the whole\\r\\ncontents in his ruffled bosom. I admired anew the economy and convenience of\\r\\nplastering, which so effectually shuts out the cold and takes a handsome\\r\\nfinish, and I learned the various casualties to which the plasterer is liable.\\r\\nI was surprised to see how thirsty the bricks were which drank up all the\\r\\nmoisture in my plaster before I had smoothed it, and how many pailfuls of water\\r\\nit takes to christen a new hearth. I had the previous winter made a small\\r\\nquantity of lime by burning the shells of the Unio fluviatilis, which\\r\\nour river affords, for the sake of the experiment; so that I knew where my\\r\\nmaterials came from. I might have got good limestone within a mile or two and\\r\\nburned it myself, if I had cared to do so.\\n\\n\\r\\nThe pond had in the mean while skimmed over in the shadiest and shallowest\\r\\ncoves, some days or even weeks before the general freezing. The first ice is\\r\\nespecially interesting and perfect, being hard, dark, and transparent, and\\r\\naffords the best opportunity that ever offers for examining the bottom where it\\r\\nis shallow; for you can lie at your length on ice only an inch thick, like a\\r\\nskater insect on the surface of the water, and study the bottom at your\\r\\nleisure, only two or three inches distant, like a picture behind a glass, and\\r\\nthe water is necessarily always smooth then. There are many furrows in the sand\\r\\nwhere some creature has travelled about and doubled on its tracks; and, for\\r\\nwrecks, it is strewn with the cases of cadis worms made of minute grains of\\r\\nwhite quartz. Perhaps these have creased it, for you find some of their cases\\r\\nin the furrows, though they are deep and broad for them to make. But the ice\\r\\nitself is the object of most interest, though you must improve the earliest\\r\\nopportunity to study it. If you examine it closely the morning after it\\r\\nfreezes, you find that the greater part of the bubbles, which at first appeared\\r\\nto be within it, are against its under surface, and that more are continually\\r\\nrising from the bottom; while the ice is as yet comparatively solid and dark,\\r\\nthat is, you see the water through it. These bubbles are from an eightieth to\\r\\nan eighth of an inch in diameter, very clear and beautiful, and you see your\\r\\nface reflected in them through the ice. There may be thirty or forty of them to\\r\\na square inch. There are also already within the ice narrow oblong\\r\\nperpendicular bubbles about half an inch long, sharp cones with the apex\\r\\nupward; or oftener, if the ice is quite fresh, minute spherical bubbles one\\r\\ndirectly above another, like a string of beads. But these within the ice are\\r\\nnot so numerous nor obvious as those beneath. I sometimes used to cast on\\r\\nstones to try the strength of the ice, and those which broke through carried in\\r\\nair with them, which formed very large and conspicuous white bubbles beneath.\\r\\nOne day when I came to the same place forty-eight hours afterward, I found that\\r\\nthose large bubbles were still perfect, though an inch more of ice had formed,\\r\\nas I could see distinctly by the seam in the edge of a cake. But as the last\\r\\ntwo days had been very warm, like an Indian summer, the ice was not now\\r\\ntransparent, showing the dark green color of the water, and the bottom, but\\r\\nopaque and whitish or gray, and though twice as thick was hardly stronger than\\r\\nbefore, for the air bubbles had greatly expanded under this heat and run\\r\\ntogether, and lost their regularity; they were no longer one directly over\\r\\nanother, but often like silvery coins poured from a bag, one overlapping\\r\\nanother, or in thin flakes, as if occupying slight cleavages. The beauty of the\\r\\nice was gone, and it was too late to study the bottom. Being curious to know\\r\\nwhat position my great bubbles occupied with regard to the new ice, I broke out\\r\\na cake containing a middling sized one, and turned it bottom upward. The new\\r\\nice had formed around and under the bubble, so that it was included between the\\r\\ntwo ices. It was wholly in the lower ice, but close against the upper, and was\\r\\nflattish, or perhaps slightly lenticular, with a rounded edge, a quarter of an\\r\\ninch deep by four inches in diameter; and I was surprised to find that directly\\r\\nunder the bubble the ice was melted with great regularity in the form of a\\r\\nsaucer reversed, to the height of five eighths of an inch in the middle,\\r\\nleaving a thin partition there between the water and the bubble, hardly an\\r\\neighth of an inch thick; and in many places the small bubbles in this partition\\r\\nhad burst out downward, and probably there was no ice at all under the largest\\r\\nbubbles, which were a foot in diameter. I inferred that the infinite number of\\r\\nminute bubbles which I had first seen against the under surface of the ice were\\r\\nnow frozen in likewise, and that each, in its degree, had operated like a\\r\\nburning glass on the ice beneath to melt and rot it. These are the little\\r\\nair-guns which contribute to make the ice crack and whoop.\\n\\n\\r\\nAt length the winter set in in good earnest, just as I had finished plastering,\\r\\nand the wind began to howl around the house as if it had not had permission to\\r\\ndo so till then. Night after night the geese came lumbering in in the dark with\\r\\na clangor and a whistling of wings, even after the ground was covered with\\r\\nsnow, some to alight in Walden, and some flying low over the woods toward Fair\\r\\nHaven, bound for Mexico. Several times, when returning from the village at ten\\r\\nor eleven o’clock at night, I heard the tread of a flock of geese, or\\r\\nelse ducks, on the dry leaves in the woods by a pond-hole behind my dwelling,\\r\\nwhere they had come up to feed, and the faint honk or quack of their leader as\\r\\nthey hurried off. In 1845 Walden froze entirely over for the first time on the\\r\\nnight of the 22d of December, Flint’s and other shallower ponds and the\\r\\nriver having been frozen ten days or more; in ’46, the 16th; in\\r\\n’49, about the 31st; and in ’50, about the 27th of December; in\\r\\n’52, the 5th of January; in ’53, the 31st of December. The snow had\\r\\nalready covered the ground since the 25th of November, and surrounded me\\r\\nsuddenly with the scenery of winter. I withdrew yet farther into my shell, and\\r\\nendeavored to keep a bright fire both within my house and within my breast. My\\r\\nemployment out of doors now was to collect the dead wood in the forest,\\r\\nbringing it in my hands or on my shoulders, or sometimes trailing a dead pine\\r\\ntree under each arm to my shed. An old forest fence which had seen its best\\r\\ndays was a great haul for me. I sacrificed it to Vulcan, for it was past\\r\\nserving the god Terminus. How much more interesting an event is that\\r\\nman’s supper who has just been forth in the snow to hunt, nay, you might\\r\\nsay, steal, the fuel to cook it with! His bread and meat are sweet. There are\\r\\nenough fagots and waste wood of all kinds in the forests of most of our towns\\r\\nto support many fires, but which at present warm none, and, some think, hinder\\r\\nthe growth of the young wood. There was also the drift-wood of the pond. In the\\r\\ncourse of the summer I had discovered a raft of pitch-pine logs with the bark\\r\\non, pinned together by the Irish when the railroad was built. This I hauled up\\r\\npartly on the shore. After soaking two years and then lying high six months it\\r\\nwas perfectly sound, though waterlogged past drying. I amused myself one winter\\r\\nday with sliding this piecemeal across the pond, nearly half a mile, skating\\r\\nbehind with one end of a log fifteen feet long on my shoulder, and the other on\\r\\nthe ice; or I tied several logs together with a birch withe, and then, with a\\r\\nlonger birch or alder which had a hook at the end, dragged them across. Though\\r\\ncompletely waterlogged and almost as heavy as lead, they not only burned long,\\r\\nbut made a very hot fire; nay, I thought that they burned better for the\\r\\nsoaking, as if the pitch, being confined by the water, burned longer, as in a\\r\\nlamp.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGilpin, in his account of the forest borderers of England, says that “the\\r\\nencroachments of trespassers, and the houses and fences thus raised on the\\r\\nborders of the forest,” were “considered as great nuisances by the\\r\\nold forest law, and were severely punished under the name of\\r\\npurprestures, as tending ad terrorem ferarum—ad nocumentum\\r\\nforestÃ¦, &c.,” to the frightening of the game and the detriment\\r\\nof the forest. But I was interested in the preservation of the venison and the\\r\\nvert more than the hunters or woodchoppers, and as much as though I had been\\r\\nthe Lord Warden himself; and if any part was burned, though I burned it myself\\r\\nby accident, I grieved with a grief that lasted longer and was more\\r\\ninconsolable than that of the proprietors; nay, I grieved when it was cut down\\r\\nby the proprietors themselves. I would that our farmers when they cut down a\\r\\nforest felt some of that awe which the old Romans did when they came to thin,\\r\\nor let in the light to, a consecrated grove (lucum conlucare), that is,\\r\\nwould believe that it is sacred to some god. The Roman made an expiatory\\r\\noffering, and prayed, Whatever god or goddess thou art to whom this grove is\\r\\nsacred, be propitious to me, my family, and children, &c.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is remarkable what a value is still put upon wood even in this age and in\\r\\nthis new country, a value more permanent and universal than that of gold. After\\r\\nall our discoveries and inventions no man will go by a pile of wood. It is as\\r\\nprecious to us as it was to our Saxon and Norman ancestors. If they made their\\r\\nbows of it, we make our gun-stocks of it. Michaux, more than thirty years ago,\\r\\nsays that the price of wood for fuel in New York and Philadelphia “nearly\\r\\nequals, and sometimes exceeds, that of the best wood in Paris, though this\\r\\nimmense capital annually requires more than three hundred thousand cords, and\\r\\nis surrounded to the distance of three hundred miles by cultivated\\r\\nplains.” In this town the price of wood rises almost steadily, and the\\r\\nonly question is, how much higher it is to be this year than it was the last.\\r\\nMechanics and tradesmen who come in person to the forest on no other errand,\\r\\nare sure to attend the wood auction, and even pay a high price for the\\r\\nprivilege of gleaning after the woodchopper. It is now many years that men have\\r\\nresorted to the forest for fuel and the materials of the arts; the New\\r\\nEnglander and the New Hollander, the Parisian and the Celt, the farmer and\\r\\nRobinhood, Goody Blake and Harry Gill, in most parts of the world the prince\\r\\nand the peasant, the scholar and the savage, equally require still a few sticks\\r\\nfrom the forest to warm them and cook their food. Neither could I do without\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEvery man looks at his wood-pile with a kind of affection. I love to have mine\\r\\nbefore my window, and the more chips the better to remind me of my pleasing\\r\\nwork. I had an old axe which nobody claimed, with which by spells in winter\\r\\ndays, on the sunny side of the house, I played about the stumps which I had got\\r\\nout of my bean-field. As my driver prophesied when I was ploughing, they warmed\\r\\nme twice, once while I was splitting them, and again when they were on the\\r\\nfire, so that no fuel could give out more heat. As for the axe, I was advised\\r\\nto get the village blacksmith to “jump” it; but I jumped him, and,\\r\\nputting a hickory helve from the woods into it, made it do. If it was dull, it\\r\\nwas at least hung true.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA few pieces of fat pine were a great treasure. It is interesting to remember\\r\\nhow much of this food for fire is still concealed in the bowels of the earth.\\r\\nIn previous years I had often gone “prospecting” over some bare\\r\\nhill-side, where a pitch-pine wood had formerly stood, and got out the fat pine\\r\\nroots. They are almost indestructible. Stumps thirty or forty years old, at\\r\\nleast, will still be sound at the core, though the sapwood has all become\\r\\nvegetable mould, as appears by the scales of the thick bark forming a ring\\r\\nlevel with the earth four or five inches distant from the heart. With axe and\\r\\nshovel you explore this mine, and follow the marrowy store, yellow as beef\\r\\ntallow, or as if you had struck on a vein of gold, deep into the earth. But\\r\\ncommonly I kindled my fire with the dry leaves of the forest, which I had\\r\\nstored up in my shed before the snow came. Green hickory finely split makes the\\r\\nwoodchopper’s kindlings, when he has a camp in the woods. Once in a while\\r\\nI got a little of this. When the villagers were lighting their fires beyond the\\r\\nhorizon, I too gave notice to the various wild inhabitants of Walden vale, by a\\r\\nsmoky streamer from my chimney, that I was awake.—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLight-winged Smoke, Icarian bird,\\r\\nMelting thy pinions in thy upward flight,\\r\\nLark without song, and messenger of dawn,\\r\\nCircling above the hamlets as thy nest;\\r\\nOr else, departing dream, and shadowy form\\r\\nOf midnight vision, gathering up thy skirts;\\r\\nBy night star-veiling, and by day\\r\\nDarkening the light and blotting out the sun;\\r\\nGo thou my incense upward from this hearth,\\r\\nAnd ask the gods to pardon this clear flame.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nHard green wood just cut, though I used but little of that, answered my purpose\\r\\nbetter than any other. I sometimes left a good fire when I went to take a walk\\r\\nin a winter afternoon; and when I returned, three or four hours afterward, it\\r\\nwould be still alive and glowing. My house was not empty though I was gone. It\\r\\nwas as if I had left a cheerful housekeeper behind. It was I and Fire that\\r\\nlived there; and commonly my housekeeper proved trustworthy. One day, however,\\r\\nas I was splitting wood, I thought that I would just look in at the window and\\r\\nsee if the house was not on fire; it was the only time I remember to have been\\r\\nparticularly anxious on this score; so I looked and saw that a spark had caught\\r\\nmy bed, and I went in and extinguished it when it had burned a place as big as\\r\\nmy hand. But my house occupied so sunny and sheltered a position, and its roof\\r\\nwas so low, that I could afford to let the fire go out in the middle of almost\\r\\nany winter day.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe moles nested in my cellar, nibbling every third potato, and making a snug\\r\\nbed even there of some hair left after plastering and of brown paper; for even\\r\\nthe wildest animals love comfort and warmth as well as man, and they survive\\r\\nthe winter only because they are so careful to secure them. Some of my friends\\r\\nspoke as if I was coming to the woods on purpose to freeze myself. The animal\\r\\nmerely makes a bed, which he warms with his body, in a sheltered place; but\\r\\nman, having discovered fire, boxes up some air in a spacious apartment, and\\r\\nwarms that, instead of robbing himself, makes that his bed, in which he can\\r\\nmove about divested of more cumbrous clothing, maintain a kind of summer in the\\r\\nmidst of winter, and by means of windows even admit the light, and with a lamp\\r\\nlengthen out the day. Thus he goes a step or two beyond instinct, and saves a\\r\\nlittle time for the fine arts. Though, when I had been exposed to the rudest\\r\\nblasts a long time, my whole body began to grow torpid, when I reached the\\r\\ngenial atmosphere of my house I soon recovered my faculties and prolonged my\\r\\nlife. But the most luxuriously housed has little to boast of in this respect,\\r\\nnor need we trouble ourselves to speculate how the human race may be at last\\r\\ndestroyed. It would be easy to cut their threads any time with a little sharper\\r\\nblast from the north. We go on dating from Cold Fridays and Great Snows; but a\\r\\nlittle colder Friday, or greater snow, would put a period to man’s\\r\\nexistence on the globe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe next winter I used a small cooking-stove for economy, since I did not own\\r\\nthe forest; but it did not keep fire so well as the open fire-place. Cooking was\\r\\nthen, for the most part, no longer a poetic, but merely a chemic process. It\\r\\nwill soon be forgotten, in these days of stoves, that we used to roast potatoes\\r\\nin the ashes, after the Indian fashion. The stove not only took up room and\\r\\nscented the house, but it concealed the fire, and I felt as if I had lost a\\r\\ncompanion. You can always see a face in the fire. The laborer, looking into it\\r\\nat evening, purifies his thoughts of the dross and earthiness which they have\\r\\naccumulated during the day. But I could no longer sit and look into the fire,\\r\\nand the pertinent words of a poet recurred to me with new force.—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n     “Never, bright flame, may be denied to me\\r\\n     Thy dear, life imaging, close sympathy.\\r\\n     What but my hopes shot upward e’er so bright?\\r\\n     What but my fortunes sunk so low in night?\\r\\n\\r\\n     Why art thou banished from our hearth and hall,\\r\\n     Thou who art welcomed and beloved by all?\\r\\n     Was thy existence then too fanciful\\r\\n     For our life’s common light, who are so dull?\\r\\n     Did thy bright gleam mysterious converse hold\\r\\n     With our congenial souls? secrets too bold?\\r\\n     Well, we are safe and strong, for now we sit\\r\\n     Beside a hearth where no dim shadows flit,\\r\\n     Where nothing cheers nor saddens, but a fire\\r\\n     Warms feet and hands—nor does to more aspire;\\r\\n     By whose compact utilitarian heap\\r\\n     The present may sit down and go to sleep,\\r\\n     Nor fear the ghosts who from the dim past walked,\\r\\n     And with us by the unequal light of the old wood fire talked.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Former Inhabitants and Winter Visitors\\n\\r\\nI weathered some merry snow storms, and spent some cheerful winter evenings by\\r\\nmy fire-side, while the snow whirled wildly without, and even the hooting of the\\r\\nowl was hushed. For many weeks I met no one in my walks but those who came\\r\\noccasionally to cut wood and sled it to the village. The elements, however,\\r\\nabetted me in making a path through the deepest snow in the woods, for when I\\r\\nhad once gone through the wind blew the oak leaves into my tracks, where they\\r\\nlodged, and by absorbing the rays of the sun melted the snow, and so not only\\r\\nmade a dry bed for my feet, but in the night their dark line was my guide. For\\r\\nhuman society I was obliged to conjure up the former occupants of these woods.\\r\\nWithin the memory of many of my townsmen the road near which my house stands\\r\\nresounded with the laugh and gossip of inhabitants, and the woods which border\\r\\nit were notched and dotted here and there with their little gardens and\\r\\ndwellings, though it was then much more shut in by the forest than now. In some\\r\\nplaces, within my own remembrance, the pines would scrape both sides of a\\r\\nchaise at once, and women and children who were compelled to go this way to\\r\\nLincoln alone and on foot did it with fear, and often ran a good part of the\\r\\ndistance. Though mainly but a humble route to neighboring villages, or for the\\r\\nwoodman’s team, it once amused the traveller more than now by its\\r\\nvariety, and lingered longer in his memory. Where now firm open fields stretch\\r\\nfrom the village to the woods, it then ran through a maple swamp on a\\r\\nfoundation of logs, the remnants of which, doubtless, still underlie the\\r\\npresent dusty highway, from the Stratton, now the Alms House, Farm, to\\r\\nBrister’s Hill.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEast of my bean-field, across the road, lived Cato Ingraham, slave of Duncan\\r\\nIngraham, Esquire, gentleman, of Concord village, who built his slave a house,\\r\\nand gave him permission to live in Walden Woods;—Cato, not Uticensis, but\\r\\nConcordiensis. Some say that he was a Guinea Negro. There are a few who\\r\\nremember his little patch among the walnuts, which he let grow up till he\\r\\nshould be old and need them; but a younger and whiter speculator got them at\\r\\nlast. He too, however, occupies an equally narrow house at present.\\r\\nCato’s half-obliterated cellar hole still remains, though known to few,\\r\\nbeing concealed from the traveller by a fringe of pines. It is now filled with\\r\\nthe smooth sumach (Rhus glabra,) and one of the earliest species of\\r\\ngolden-rod (Solidago stricta) grows there luxuriantly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere, by the very corner of my field, still nearer to town, Zilpha, a colored\\r\\nwoman, had her little house, where she spun linen for the townsfolk, making the\\r\\nWalden Woods ring with her shrill singing, for she had a loud and notable\\r\\nvoice. At length, in the war of 1812, her dwelling was set on fire by English\\r\\nsoldiers, prisoners on parole, when she was away, and her cat and dog and hens\\r\\nwere all burned up together. She led a hard life, and somewhat inhumane. One\\r\\nold frequenter of these woods remembers, that as he passed her house one noon\\r\\nhe heard her muttering to herself over her gurgling pot,—“Ye are all\\r\\nbones, bones!” I have seen bricks amid the oak copse there.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDown the road, on the right hand, on Brister’s Hill, lived Brister\\r\\nFreeman, “a handy Negro,” slave of Squire Cummings once,—there\\r\\nwhere grow still the apple-trees which Brister planted and tended; large old\\r\\ntrees now, but their fruit still wild and ciderish to my taste. Not long since\\r\\nI read his epitaph in the old Lincoln burying-ground, a little on one side,\\r\\nnear the unmarked graves of some British grenadiers who fell in the retreat\\r\\nfrom Concord,—where he is styled “Sippio Brister,”—Scipio\\r\\nAfricanus he had some title to be called,—“a man of color,” as\\r\\nif he were discolored. It also told me, with staring emphasis, when he died;\\r\\nwhich was but an indirect way of informing me that he ever lived. With him\\r\\ndwelt Fenda, his hospitable wife, who told fortunes, yet\\r\\npleasantly,—large, round, and black, blacker than any of the children of\\r\\nnight, such a dusky orb as never rose on Concord before or since.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFarther down the hill, on the left, on the old road in the woods, are marks of\\r\\nsome homestead of the Stratton family; whose orchard once covered all the slope\\r\\nof Brister’s Hill, but was long since killed out by pitch pines,\\r\\nexcepting a few stumps, whose old roots furnish still the wild stocks of many a\\r\\nthrifty village tree.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNearer yet to town, you come to Breed’s location, on the other side of\\r\\nthe way, just on the edge of the wood; ground famous for the pranks of a demon\\r\\nnot distinctly named in old mythology, who has acted a prominent and astounding\\r\\npart in our New England life, and deserves, as much as any mythological\\r\\ncharacter, to have his biography written one day; who first comes in the guise\\r\\nof a friend or hired man, and then robs and murders the whole\\r\\nfamily,—New-England Rum. But history must not yet tell the tragedies\\r\\nenacted here; let time intervene in some measure to assuage and lend an azure\\r\\ntint to them. Here the most indistinct and dubious tradition says that once a\\r\\ntavern stood; the well the same, which tempered the traveller’s beverage\\r\\nand refreshed his steed. Here then men saluted one another, and heard and told\\r\\nthe news, and went their ways again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBreed’s hut was standing only a dozen years ago, though it had long been\\r\\nunoccupied. It was about the size of mine. It was set on fire by mischievous\\r\\nboys, one Election night, if I do not mistake. I lived on the edge of the\\r\\nvillage then, and had just lost myself over Davenant’s Gondibert, that\\r\\nwinter that I labored with a lethargy,—which, by the way, I never knew\\r\\nwhether to regard as a family complaint, having an uncle who goes to sleep\\r\\nshaving himself, and is obliged to sprout potatoes in a cellar Sundays, in\\r\\norder to keep awake and keep the Sabbath, or as the consequence of my attempt\\r\\nto read Chalmers’ collection of English poetry without skipping. It\\r\\nfairly overcame my Nervii. I had just sunk my head on this when the bells rung\\r\\nfire, and in hot haste the engines rolled that way, led by a straggling troop\\r\\nof men and boys, and I among the foremost, for I had leaped the brook. We\\r\\nthought it was far south over the woods,—we who had run to fires\\r\\nbefore,—barn, shop, or dwelling-house, or all together. “It’s\\r\\nBaker’s barn,” cried one. “It is the Codman place,”\\r\\naffirmed another. And then fresh sparks went up above the wood, as if the roof\\r\\nfell in, and we all shouted “Concord to the rescue!” Wagons shot\\r\\npast with furious speed and crushing loads, bearing, perchance, among the rest,\\r\\nthe agent of the Insurance Company, who was bound to go however far; and ever\\r\\nand anon the engine bell tinkled behind, more slow and sure; and rearmost of\\r\\nall, as it was afterward whispered, came they who set the fire and gave the\\r\\nalarm. Thus we kept on like true idealists, rejecting the evidence of our\\r\\nsenses, until at a turn in the road we heard the crackling and actually felt\\r\\nthe heat of the fire from over the wall, and realized, alas! that we were\\r\\nthere. The very nearness of the fire but cooled our ardor. At first we thought\\r\\nto throw a frog-pond on to it; but concluded to let it burn, it was so far gone\\r\\nand so worthless. So we stood round our engine, jostled one another, expressed\\r\\nour sentiments through speaking-trumpets, or in lower tone referred to the\\r\\ngreat conflagrations which the world has witnessed, including Bascom’s\\r\\nshop, and, between ourselves, we thought that, were we there in season with our\\r\\n“tub,” and a full frog-pond by, we could turn that threatened last\\r\\nand universal one into another flood. We finally retreated without doing any\\r\\nmischief,—returned to sleep and Gondibert. But as for Gondibert, I would\\r\\nexcept that passage in the preface about wit being the soul’s\\r\\npowder,—“but most of mankind are strangers to wit, as Indians are\\r\\nto powder.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt chanced that I walked that way across the fields the following night, about\\r\\nthe same hour, and hearing a low moaning at this spot, I drew near in the dark,\\r\\nand discovered the only survivor of the family that I know, the heir of both\\r\\nits virtues and its vices, who alone was interested in this burning, lying on\\r\\nhis stomach and looking over the cellar wall at the still smouldering cinders\\r\\nbeneath, muttering to himself, as is his wont. He had been working far off in\\r\\nthe river meadows all day, and had improved the first moments that he could\\r\\ncall his own to visit the home of his fathers and his youth. He gazed into the\\r\\ncellar from all sides and points of view by turns, always lying down to it, as\\r\\nif there was some treasure, which he remembered, concealed between the stones,\\r\\nwhere there was absolutely nothing but a heap of bricks and ashes. The house\\r\\nbeing gone, he looked at what there was left. He was soothed by the sympathy\\r\\nwhich my mere presence implied, and showed me, as well as the darkness\\r\\npermitted, where the well was covered up; which, thank Heaven, could never be\\r\\nburned; and he groped long about the wall to find the well-sweep which his\\r\\nfather had cut and mounted, feeling for the iron hook or staple by which a\\r\\nburden had been fastened to the heavy end,—all that he could now cling\\r\\nto,—to convince me that it was no common “rider.” I felt it,\\r\\nand still remark it almost daily in my walks, for by it hangs the history of a\\r\\nfamily.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOnce more, on the left, where are seen the well and lilac bushes by the wall,\\r\\nin the now open field, lived Nutting and Le Grosse. But to return toward\\r\\nLincoln.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFarther in the woods than any of these, where the road approaches nearest to\\r\\nthe pond, Wyman the potter squatted, and furnished his townsmen with earthen\\r\\nware, and left descendants to succeed him. Neither were they rich in worldly\\r\\ngoods, holding the land by sufferance while they lived; and there often the\\r\\nsheriff came in vain to collect the taxes, and “attached a chip,”\\r\\nfor form’s sake, as I have read in his accounts, there being nothing else\\r\\nthat he could lay his hands on. One day in midsummer, when I was hoeing, a man\\r\\nwho was carrying a load of pottery to market stopped his horse against my field\\r\\nand inquired concerning Wyman the younger. He had long ago bought a\\r\\npotter’s wheel of him, and wished to know what had become of him. I had\\r\\nread of the potter’s clay and wheel in Scripture, but it had never\\r\\noccurred to me that the pots we use were not such as had come down unbroken\\r\\nfrom those days, or grown on trees like gourds somewhere, and I was pleased to\\r\\nhear that so fictile an art was ever practiced in my neighborhood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe last inhabitant of these woods before me was an Irishman, Hugh Quoil (if I\\r\\nhave spelt his name with coil enough,) who occupied Wyman’s\\r\\ntenement,—Col. Quoil, he was called. Rumor said that he had been a soldier\\r\\nat Waterloo. If he had lived I should have made him fight his battles over\\r\\nagain. His trade here was that of a ditcher. Napoleon went to St. Helena; Quoil\\r\\ncame to Walden Woods. All I know of him is tragic. He was a man of manners,\\r\\nlike one who had seen the world, and was capable of more civil speech than you\\r\\ncould well attend to. He wore a great coat in mid-summer, being affected with the\\r\\ntrembling delirium, and his face was the color of carmine. He died in the road\\r\\nat the foot of Brister’s Hill shortly after I came to the woods, so that\\r\\nI have not remembered him as a neighbor. Before his house was pulled down, when\\r\\nhis comrades avoided it as “an unlucky castle,” I visited it. There\\r\\nlay his old clothes curled up by use, as if they were himself, upon his raised\\r\\nplank bed. His pipe lay broken on the hearth, instead of a bowl broken at the\\r\\nfountain. The last could never have been the symbol of his death, for he\\r\\nconfessed to me that, though he had heard of Brister’s Spring, he had\\r\\nnever seen it; and soiled cards, kings of diamonds spades and hearts, were\\r\\nscattered over the floor. One black chicken which the administrator could not\\r\\ncatch, black as night and as silent, not even croaking, awaiting Reynard, still\\r\\nwent to roost in the next apartment. In the rear there was the dim outline of a\\r\\ngarden, which had been planted but had never received its first hoeing, owing\\r\\nto those terrible shaking fits, though it was now harvest time. It was over-run\\r\\nwith Roman wormwood and beggar-ticks, which last stuck to my clothes for all\\r\\nfruit. The skin of a woodchuck was freshly stretched upon the back of the\\r\\nhouse, a trophy of his last Waterloo; but no warm cap or mittens would he want\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow only a dent in the earth marks the site of these dwellings, with buried\\r\\ncellar stones, and strawberries, raspberries, thimble-berries, hazel-bushes,\\r\\nand sumachs growing in the sunny sward there; some pitch-pine or gnarled oak\\r\\noccupies what was the chimney nook, and a sweet-scented black-birch, perhaps,\\r\\nwaves where the door-stone was. Sometimes the well dent is visible, where once\\r\\na spring oozed; now dry and tearless grass; or it was covered deep,—not to\\r\\nbe discovered till some late day,—with a flat stone under the sod, when\\r\\nthe last of the race departed. What a sorrowful act must that be,—the\\r\\ncovering up of wells! coincident with the opening of wells of tears. These\\r\\ncellar dents, like deserted fox burrows, old holes, are all that is left where\\r\\nonce were the stir and bustle of human life, and “fate, free-will,\\r\\nforeknowledge absolute,” in some form and dialect or other were by turns\\r\\ndiscussed. But all I can learn of their conclusions amounts to just this, that\\r\\n“Cato and Brister pulled wool;” which is about as edifying as the\\r\\nhistory of more famous schools of philosophy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nStill grows the vivacious lilac a generation after the door and lintel and the\\r\\nsill are gone, unfolding its sweet-scented flowers each spring, to be plucked\\r\\nby the musing traveller; planted and tended once by children’s hands, in\\r\\nfront-yard plots,—now standing by wall-sides in retired pastures, and\\r\\ngiving place to new-rising forests;—the last of that stirp, sole survivor\\r\\nof that family. Little did the dusky children think that the puny slip with its\\r\\ntwo eyes only, which they stuck in the ground in the shadow of the house and\\r\\ndaily watered, would root itself so, and outlive them, and house itself in the\\r\\nrear that shaded it, and grown man’s garden and orchard, and tell their\\r\\nstory faintly to the lone wanderer a half century after they had grown up and\\r\\ndied,—blossoming as fair, and smelling as sweet, as in that first spring.\\r\\nI mark its still tender, civil, cheerful, lilac colors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut this small village, germ of something more, why did it fail while Concord\\r\\nkeeps its ground? Were there no natural advantages,—no water privileges,\\r\\nforsooth? Ay, the deep Walden Pond and cool Brister’s\\r\\nSpring,—privilege to drink long and healthy draughts at these, all\\r\\nunimproved by these men but to dilute their glass. They were universally a\\r\\nthirsty race. Might not the basket, stable-broom, mat-making, corn-parching,\\r\\nlinen-spinning, and pottery business have thrived here, making the wilderness\\r\\nto blossom like the rose, and a numerous posterity have inherited the land of\\r\\ntheir fathers? The sterile soil would at least have been proof against a\\r\\nlow-land degeneracy. Alas! how little does the memory of these human\\r\\ninhabitants enhance the beauty of the landscape! Again, perhaps, Nature will\\r\\ntry, with me for a first settler, and my house raised last spring to be the\\r\\noldest in the hamlet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI am not aware that any man has ever built on the spot which I occupy. Deliver\\r\\nme from a city built on the site of a more ancient city, whose materials are\\r\\nruins, whose gardens cemeteries. The soil is blanched and accursed there, and\\r\\nbefore that becomes necessary the earth itself will be destroyed. With such\\r\\nreminiscences I repeopled the woods and lulled myself asleep.\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this season I seldom had a visitor. When the snow lay deepest no wanderer\\r\\nventured near my house for a week or fortnight at a time, but there I lived as\\r\\nsnug as a meadow mouse, or as cattle and poultry which are said to have\\r\\nsurvived for a long time buried in drifts, even without food; or like that\\r\\nearly settler’s family in the town of Sutton, in this state, whose\\r\\ncottage was completely covered by the great snow of 1717 when he was absent,\\r\\nand an Indian found it only by the hole which the chimney’s breath made\\r\\nin the drift, and so relieved the family. But no friendly Indian concerned\\r\\nhimself about me; nor needed he, for the master of the house was at home. The\\r\\nGreat Snow! How cheerful it is to hear of! When the farmers could not get to\\r\\nthe woods and swamps with their teams, and were obliged to cut down the shade\\r\\ntrees before their houses, and when the crust was harder, cut off the trees in\\r\\nthe swamps, ten feet from the ground, as it appeared the next spring.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the deepest snows, the path which I used from the highway to my house, about\\r\\nhalf a mile long, might have been represented by a meandering dotted line, with\\r\\nwide intervals between the dots. For a week of even weather I took exactly the\\r\\nsame number of steps, and of the same length, coming and going, stepping\\r\\ndeliberately and with the precision of a pair of dividers in my own deep\\r\\ntracks,—to such routine the winter reduces us,—yet often they were\\r\\nfilled with heaven’s own blue. But no weather interfered fatally with my\\r\\nwalks, or rather my going abroad, for I frequently tramped eight or ten miles\\r\\nthrough the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech-tree, or a\\r\\nyellow-birch, or an old acquaintance among the pines; when the ice and snow\\r\\ncausing their limbs to droop, and so sharpening their tops, had changed the\\r\\npines into fir-trees; wading to the tops of the highest hills when the snow was\\r\\nnearly two feet deep on a level, and shaking down another snow-storm on my head\\r\\nat every step; or sometimes creeping and floundering thither on my hands and\\r\\nknees, when the hunters had gone into winter quarters. One afternoon I amused\\r\\nmyself by watching a barred owl (Strix nebulosa) sitting on one of the\\r\\nlower dead limbs of a white-pine, close to the trunk, in broad daylight, I\\r\\nstanding within a rod of him. He could hear me when I moved and cronched the\\r\\nsnow with my feet, but could not plainly see me. When I made most noise he\\r\\nwould stretch out his neck, and erect his neck feathers, and open his eyes\\r\\nwide; but their lids soon fell again, and he began to nod. I too felt a\\r\\nslumberous influence after watching him half an hour, as he sat thus with his\\r\\neyes half open, like a cat, winged brother of the cat. There was only a narrow\\r\\nslit left between their lids, by which he preserved a peninsular relation to\\r\\nme; thus, with half-shut eyes, looking out from the land of dreams, and\\r\\nendeavoring to realize me, vague object or mote that interrupted his visions.\\r\\nAt length, on some louder noise or my nearer approach, he would grow uneasy and\\r\\nsluggishly turn about on his perch, as if impatient at having his dreams\\r\\ndisturbed; and when he launched himself off and flapped through the pines,\\r\\nspreading his wings to unexpected breadth, I could not hear the slightest sound\\r\\nfrom them. Thus, guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of\\r\\ntheir neighborhood than by sight, feeling his twilight way as it were with\\r\\nhis sensitive pinions, he found a new perch, where he might in peace await the\\r\\ndawning of his day.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I walked over the long causeway made for the railroad through the meadows, I\\r\\nencountered many a blustering and nipping wind, for nowhere has it freer play;\\r\\nand when the frost had smitten me on one cheek, heathen as I was, I turned to\\r\\nit the other also. Nor was it much better by the carriage road from\\r\\nBrister’s Hill. For I came to town still, like a friendly Indian, when\\r\\nthe contents of the broad open fields were all piled up between the walls of\\r\\nthe Walden road, and half an hour sufficed to obliterate the tracks of the last\\r\\ntraveller. And when I returned new drifts would have formed, through which I\\r\\nfloundered, where the busy north-west wind had been depositing the powdery snow\\r\\nround a sharp angle in the road, and not a rabbit’s track, nor even the\\r\\nfine print, the small type, of a meadow mouse was to be seen. Yet I rarely\\r\\nfailed to find, even in mid-winter, some warm and springly swamp where the grass\\r\\nand the skunk-cabbage still put forth with perennial verdure, and some hardier\\r\\nbird occasionally awaited the return of spring.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSometimes, notwithstanding the snow, when I returned from my walk at evening I\\r\\ncrossed the deep tracks of a woodchopper leading from my door, and found his\\r\\npile of whittlings on the hearth, and my house filled with the odor of his\\r\\npipe. Or on a Sunday afternoon, if I chanced to be at home, I heard the\\r\\ncronching of the snow made by the step of a long-headed farmer, who from far\\r\\nthrough the woods sought my house, to have a social “crack;” one of\\r\\nthe few of his vocation who are “men on their farms;” who donned a\\r\\nfrock instead of a professor’s gown, and is as ready to extract the moral\\r\\nout of church or state as to haul a load of manure from his barn-yard. We\\r\\ntalked of rude and simple times, when men sat about large fires in cold\\r\\nbracing weather, with clear heads; and when other dessert failed, we tried our\\r\\nteeth on many a nut which wise squirrels have long since abandoned, for those\\r\\nwhich have the thickest shells are commonly empty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe one who came from farthest to my lodge, through deepest snows and most\\r\\ndismal tempests, was a poet. A farmer, a hunter, a soldier, a reporter, even a\\r\\nphilosopher, may be daunted; but nothing can deter a poet, for he is actuated\\r\\nby pure love. Who can predict his comings and goings? His business calls him\\r\\nout at all hours, even when doctors sleep. We made that small house ring with\\r\\nboisterous mirth and resound with the murmur of much sober talk, making amends\\r\\nthen to Walden vale for the long silences. Broadway was still and deserted in\\r\\ncomparison. At suitable intervals there were regular salutes of laughter, which\\r\\nmight have been referred indifferently to the last uttered or the forth-coming\\r\\njest. We made many a “bran new” theory of life over a thin dish of\\r\\ngruel, which combined the advantages of conviviality with the clear-headedness\\r\\nwhich philosophy requires.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI should not forget that during my last winter at the pond there was another\\r\\nwelcome visitor, who at one time came through the village, through snow and\\r\\nrain and darkness, till he saw my lamp through the trees, and shared with me\\r\\nsome long winter evenings. One of the last of the\\r\\nphilosophers,—Connecticut gave him to the world,—he peddled first her\\r\\nwares, afterwards, as he declares, his brains. These he peddles still,\\r\\nprompting God and disgracing man, bearing for fruit his brain only, like the\\r\\nnut its kernel. I think that he must be the man of the most faith of any alive.\\r\\nHis words and attitude always suppose a better state of things than other men\\r\\nare acquainted with, and he will be the last man to be disappointed as the ages\\r\\nrevolve. He has no venture in the present. But though comparatively disregarded\\r\\nnow, when his day comes, laws unsuspected by most will take effect, and masters\\r\\nof families and rulers will come to him for advice.—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n     “How blind that cannot see serenity!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA true friend of man; almost the only friend of human progress. An Old\\r\\nMortality, say rather an Immortality, with unwearied patience and faith making\\r\\nplain the image engraven in men’s bodies, the God of whom they are but\\r\\ndefaced and leaning monuments. With his hospitable intellect he embraces\\r\\nchildren, beggars, insane, and scholars, and entertains the thought of all,\\r\\nadding to it commonly some breadth and elegance. I think that he should keep a\\r\\ncaravansary on the world’s highway, where philosophers of all nations\\r\\nmight put up, and on his sign should be printed, “Entertainment for man,\\r\\nbut not for his beast. Enter ye that have leisure and a quiet mind, who\\r\\nearnestly seek the right road.” He is perhaps the sanest man and has the\\r\\nfewest crotchets of any I chance to know; the same yesterday and tomorrow. Of\\r\\nyore we had sauntered and talked, and effectually put the world behind us; for\\r\\nhe was pledged to no institution in it, freeborn, ingenuus. Whichever\\r\\nway we turned, it seemed that the heavens and the earth had met together, since\\r\\nhe enhanced the beauty of the landscape. A blue-robed man, whose fittest roof\\r\\nis the overarching sky which reflects his serenity. I do not see how he can\\r\\never die; Nature cannot spare him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHaving each some shingles of thought well dried, we sat and whittled them,\\r\\ntrying our knives, and admiring the clear yellowish grain of the pumpkin pine.\\r\\nWe waded so gently and reverently, or we pulled together so smoothly, that the\\r\\nfishes of thought were not scared from the stream, nor feared any angler on the\\r\\nbank, but came and went grandly, like the clouds which float through the\\r\\nwestern sky, and the mother-o’-pearl flocks which sometimes form and\\r\\ndissolve there. There we worked, revising mythology, rounding a fable here and\\r\\nthere, and building castles in the air for which earth offered no worthy\\r\\nfoundation. Great Looker! Great Expecter! to converse with whom was a New\\r\\nEngland Night’s Entertainment. Ah! such discourse we had, hermit and\\r\\nphilosopher, and the old settler I have spoken of,—we three,—it\\r\\nexpanded and racked my little house; I should not dare to say how many\\r\\npounds’ weight there was above the atmospheric pressure on every circular\\r\\ninch; it opened its seams so that they had to be calked with much dulness\\r\\nthereafter to stop the consequent leak;—but I had enough of that kind of\\r\\noakum already picked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was one other with whom I had “solid seasons,” long to be\\r\\nremembered, at his house in the village, and who looked in upon me from time to\\r\\ntime; but I had no more for society there.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere too, as every where, I sometimes expected the Visitor who never comes. The\\r\\nVishnu Purana says, “The house-holder is to remain at eventide in his\\r\\ncourt-yard as long as it takes to milk a cow, or longer if he pleases, to await\\r\\nthe arrival of a guest.” I often performed this duty of hospitality,\\r\\nwaited long enough to milk a whole herd of cows, but did not see the man\\r\\napproaching from the town.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Winter Animals\\n\\r\\nWhen the ponds were firmly frozen, they afforded not only new and shorter\\r\\nroutes to many points, but new views from their surfaces of the familiar\\r\\nlandscape around them. When I crossed Flint’s Pond, after it was covered\\r\\nwith snow, though I had often paddled about and skated over it, it was so\\r\\nunexpectedly wide and so strange that I could think of nothing but\\r\\nBaffin’s Bay. The Lincoln hills rose up around me at the extremity of a\\r\\nsnowy plain, in which I did not remember to have stood before; and the\\r\\nfishermen, at an indeterminable distance over the ice, moving slowly about with\\r\\ntheir wolfish dogs, passed for sealers or Esquimaux, or in misty weather\\r\\nloomed like fabulous creatures, and I did not know whether they were giants or\\r\\npygmies. I took this course when I went to lecture in Lincoln in the evening,\\r\\ntravelling in no road and passing no house between my own hut and the lecture\\r\\nroom. In Goose Pond, which lay in my way, a colony of muskrats dwelt, and\\r\\nraised their cabins high above the ice, though none could be seen abroad when I\\r\\ncrossed it. Walden, being like the rest usually bare of snow, or with only\\r\\nshallow and interrupted drifts on it, was my yard, where I could walk freely\\r\\nwhen the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level elsewhere and the villagers\\r\\nwere confined to their streets. There, far from the village street, and except\\r\\nat very long intervals, from the jingle of sleigh-bells, I slid and skated, as\\r\\nin a vast moose-yard well trodden, overhung by oak woods and solemn pines bent\\r\\ndown with snow or bristling with icicles.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor sounds in winter nights, and often in winter days, I heard the forlorn but\\r\\nmelodious note of a hooting owl indefinitely far; such a sound as the frozen\\r\\nearth would yield if struck with a suitable plectrum, the very lingua\\r\\nvernacula of Walden Wood, and quite familiar to me at last, though I never\\r\\nsaw the bird while it was making it. I seldom opened my door in a winter\\r\\nevening without hearing it; Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer, hoo, sounded\\r\\nsonorously, and the first three syllables accented somewhat like how der\\r\\ndo; or sometimes hoo hoo only. One night in the beginning of\\r\\nwinter, before the pond froze over, about nine o’clock, I was startled by\\r\\nthe loud honking of a goose, and, stepping to the door, heard the sound of\\r\\ntheir wings like a tempest in the woods as they flew low over my house. They\\r\\npassed over the pond toward Fair Haven, seemingly deterred from settling by my\\r\\nlight, their commodore honking all the while with a regular beat. Suddenly an\\r\\nunmistakable cat-owl from very near me, with the most harsh and tremendous\\r\\nvoice I ever heard from any inhabitant of the woods, responded at regular\\r\\nintervals to the goose, as if determined to expose and disgrace this intruder\\r\\nfrom Hudson’s Bay by exhibiting a greater compass and volume of voice in\\r\\na native, and boo-hoo him out of Concord horizon. What do you mean by\\r\\nalarming the citadel at this time of night consecrated to me? Do you think I am\\r\\never caught napping at such an hour, and that I have not got lungs and a larynx\\r\\nas well as yourself? Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo! It was one of the most\\r\\nthrilling discords I ever heard. And yet, if you had a discriminating ear,\\r\\nthere were in it the elements of a concord such as these plains never saw nor\\r\\nheard.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI also heard the whooping of the ice in the pond, my great bed-fellow in that\\r\\npart of Concord, as if it were restless in its bed and would fain turn over,\\r\\nwere troubled with flatulency and had dreams; or I was waked by the cracking of\\r\\nthe ground by the frost, as if some one had driven a team against my door, and\\r\\nin the morning would find a crack in the earth a quarter of a mile long and a\\r\\nthird of an inch wide.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSometimes I heard the foxes as they ranged over the snow crust, in moonlight\\r\\nnights, in search of a partridge or other game, barking raggedly and\\r\\ndemoniacally like forest dogs, as if laboring with some anxiety, or seeking\\r\\nexpression, struggling for light and to be dogs outright and run freely in the\\r\\nstreets; for if we take the ages into our account, may there not be a\\r\\ncivilization going on among brutes as well as men? They seemed to me to be\\r\\nrudimental, burrowing men, still standing on their defence, awaiting their\\r\\ntransformation. Sometimes one came near to my window, attracted by my light,\\r\\nbarked a vulpine curse at me, and then retreated.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUsually the red squirrel (Sciurus Hudsonius) waked me in the dawn,\\r\\ncoursing over the roof and up and down the sides of the house, as if sent out\\r\\nof the woods for this purpose. In the course of the winter I threw out half a\\r\\nbushel of ears of sweet-corn, which had not got ripe, on to the snow crust by\\r\\nmy door, and was amused by watching the motions of the various animals which\\r\\nwere baited by it. In the twilight and the night the rabbits came regularly and\\r\\nmade a hearty meal. All day long the red squirrels came and went, and afforded\\r\\nme much entertainment by their manÅ\\x93uvres. One would approach at first warily\\r\\nthrough the shrub-oaks, running over the snow crust by fits and starts like a\\r\\nleaf blown by the wind, now a few paces this way, with wonderful speed and\\r\\nwaste of energy, making inconceivable haste with his “trotters,” as\\r\\nif it were for a wager, and now as many paces that way, but never getting on\\r\\nmore than half a rod at a time; and then suddenly pausing with a ludicrous\\r\\nexpression and a gratuitous somerset, as if all the eyes in the universe were\\r\\nfixed on him,—for all the motions of a squirrel, even in the most\\r\\nsolitary recesses of the forest, imply spectators as much as those of a dancing\\r\\ngirl,—wasting more time in delay and circumspection than would have\\r\\nsufficed to walk the whole distance,—I never saw one walk,—and then\\r\\nsuddenly, before you could say Jack Robinson, he would be in the top of a young\\r\\npitch-pine, winding up his clock and chiding all imaginary spectators,\\r\\nsoliloquizing and talking to all the universe at the same time,—for no\\r\\nreason that I could ever detect, or he himself was aware of, I suspect. At\\r\\nlength he would reach the corn, and selecting a suitable ear, frisk about in\\r\\nthe same uncertain trigonometrical way to the top-most stick of my wood-pile,\\r\\nbefore my window, where he looked me in the face, and there sit for hours,\\r\\nsupplying himself with a new ear from time to time, nibbling at first\\r\\nvoraciously and throwing the half-naked cobs about; till at length he grew more\\r\\ndainty still and played with his food, tasting only the inside of the kernel,\\r\\nand the ear, which was held balanced over the stick by one paw, slipped from\\r\\nhis careless grasp and fell to the ground, when he would look over at it with a\\r\\nludicrous expression of uncertainty, as if suspecting that it had life, with a\\r\\nmind not made up whether to get it again, or a new one, or be off; now thinking\\r\\nof corn, then listening to hear what was in the wind. So the little impudent\\r\\nfellow would waste many an ear in a forenoon; till at last, seizing some longer\\r\\nand plumper one, considerably bigger than himself, and skilfully balancing it,\\r\\nhe would set out with it to the woods, like a tiger with a buffalo, by the same\\r\\nzig-zag course and frequent pauses, scratching along with it as if it were too\\r\\nheavy for him and falling all the while, making its fall a diagonal between a\\r\\nperpendicular and horizontal, being determined to put it through at any\\r\\nrate;—a singularly frivolous and whimsical fellow;—and so he would\\r\\nget off with it to where he lived, perhaps carry it to the top of a pine tree\\r\\nforty or fifty rods distant, and I would afterwards find the cobs strewn about\\r\\nthe woods in various directions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt length the jays arrive, whose discordant screams were heard long before, as\\r\\nthey were warily making their approach an eighth of a mile off, and in a\\r\\nstealthy and sneaking manner they flit from tree to tree, nearer and nearer,\\r\\nand pick up the kernels which the squirrels have dropped. Then, sitting on a\\r\\npitch-pine bough, they attempt to swallow in their haste a kernel which is too\\r\\nbig for their throats and chokes them; and after great labor they disgorge it,\\r\\nand spend an hour in the endeavor to crack it by repeated blows with their\\r\\nbills. They were manifestly thieves, and I had not much respect for them; but\\r\\nthe squirrels, though at first shy, went to work as if they were taking what\\r\\nwas their own.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile also came the chickadees in flocks, which, picking up the crumbs the\\r\\nsquirrels had dropped, flew to the nearest twig, and, placing them under their\\r\\nclaws, hammered away at them with their little bills, as if it were an insect\\r\\nin the bark, till they were sufficiently reduced for their slender throats. A\\r\\nlittle flock of these tit-mice came daily to pick a dinner out of my wood-pile,\\r\\nor the crumbs at my door, with faint flitting lisping notes, like the tinkling\\r\\nof icicles in the grass, or else with sprightly day day day, or more\\r\\nrarely, in spring-like days, a wiry summery phe-be from the wood-side.\\r\\nThey were so familiar that at length one alighted on an armful of wood which I\\r\\nwas carrying in, and pecked at the sticks without fear. I once had a sparrow\\r\\nalight upon my shoulder for a moment while I was hoeing in a village garden,\\r\\nand I felt that I was more distinguished by that circumstance than I should\\r\\nhave been by any epaulet I could have worn. The squirrels also grew at last to\\r\\nbe quite familiar, and occasionally stepped upon my shoe, when that was the\\r\\nnearest way.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the ground was not yet quite covered, and again near the end of winter,\\r\\nwhen the snow was melted on my south hill-side and about my wood-pile, the\\r\\npartridges came out of the woods morning and evening to feed there. Whichever\\r\\nside you walk in the woods the partridge bursts away on whirring wings, jarring\\r\\nthe snow from the dry leaves and twigs on high, which comes sifting down in the\\r\\nsun-beams like golden dust; for this brave bird is not to be scared by winter.\\r\\nIt is frequently covered up by drifts, and, it is said, “sometimes\\r\\nplunges from on wing into the soft snow, where it remains concealed for a day\\r\\nor two.” I used to start them in the open land also, where they had come\\r\\nout of the woods at sunset to “bud” the wild apple-trees. They will\\r\\ncome regularly every evening to particular trees, where the cunning sportsman\\r\\nlies in wait for them, and the distant orchards next the woods suffer thus not\\r\\na little. I am glad that the partridge gets fed, at any rate. It is\\r\\nNature’s own bird which lives on buds and diet-drink.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn dark winter mornings, or in short winter afternoons, I sometimes heard a\\r\\npack of hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry and yelp, unable to\\r\\nresist the instinct of the chase, and the note of the hunting horn at\\r\\nintervals, proving that man was in the rear. The woods ring again, and yet no\\r\\nfox bursts forth on to the open level of the pond, nor following pack pursuing\\r\\ntheir ActÃ¦on. And perhaps at evening I see the hunters returning with a\\r\\nsingle brush trailing from their sleigh for a trophy, seeking their inn. They\\r\\ntell me that if the fox would remain in the bosom of the frozen earth he would\\r\\nbe safe, or if he would run in a straight line away no fox-hound could overtake\\r\\nhim; but, having left his pursuers far behind, he stops to rest and listen till\\r\\nthey come up, and when he runs he circles round to his old haunts, where the\\r\\nhunters await him. Sometimes, however, he will run upon a wall many rods, and\\r\\nthen leap off far to one side, and he appears to know that water will not\\r\\nretain his scent. A hunter told me that he once saw a fox pursued by hounds\\r\\nburst out on to Walden when the ice was covered with shallow puddles, run part\\r\\nway across, and then return to the same shore. Ere long the hounds arrived, but\\r\\nhere they lost the scent. Sometimes a pack hunting by themselves would pass my\\r\\ndoor, and circle round my house, and yelp and hound without regarding me, as if\\r\\nafflicted by a species of madness, so that nothing could divert them from the\\r\\npursuit. Thus they circle until they fall upon the recent trail of a fox, for a\\r\\nwise hound will forsake every thing else for this. One day a man came to my hut\\r\\nfrom Lexington to inquire after his hound that made a large track, and had been\\r\\nhunting for a week by himself. But I fear that he was not the wiser for all I\\r\\ntold him, for every time I attempted to answer his questions he interrupted me\\r\\nby asking, “What do you do here?” He had lost a dog, but found a\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne old hunter who has a dry tongue, who used to come to bathe in Walden once\\r\\nevery year when the water was warmest, and at such times looked in upon me,\\r\\ntold me that many years ago he took his gun one afternoon and went out for a\\r\\ncruise in Walden Wood; and as he walked the Wayland road he heard the cry of\\r\\nhounds approaching, and ere long a fox leaped the wall into the road, and as\\r\\nquick as thought leaped the other wall out of the road, and his swift bullet\\r\\nhad not touched him. Some way behind came an old hound and her three pups in\\r\\nfull pursuit, hunting on their own account, and disappeared again in the woods.\\r\\nLate in the afternoon, as he was resting in the thick woods south of Walden, he\\r\\nheard the voice of the hounds far over toward Fair Haven still pursuing the\\r\\nfox; and on they came, their hounding cry which made all the woods ring\\r\\nsounding nearer and nearer, now from Well-Meadow, now from the Baker Farm. For\\r\\na long time he stood still and listened to their music, so sweet to a\\r\\nhunter’s ear, when suddenly the fox appeared, threading the solemn aisles\\r\\nwith an easy coursing pace, whose sound was concealed by a sympathetic rustle\\r\\nof the leaves, swift and still, keeping the ground, leaving his pursuers far\\r\\nbehind; and, leaping upon a rock amid the woods, he sat erect and listening,\\r\\nwith his back to the hunter. For a moment compassion restrained the\\r\\nlatter’s arm; but that was a short-lived mood, and as quick as thought\\r\\ncan follow thought his piece was levelled, and whang!—the fox\\r\\nrolling over the rock lay dead on the ground. The hunter still kept his place\\r\\nand listened to the hounds. Still on they came, and now the near woods\\r\\nresounded through all their aisles with their demoniac cry. At length the old\\r\\nhound burst into view with muzzle to the ground, and snapping the air as if\\r\\npossessed, and ran directly to the rock; but spying the dead fox she suddenly\\r\\nceased her hounding as if struck dumb with amazement, and walked round and\\r\\nround him in silence; and one by one her pups arrived, and, like their mother,\\r\\nwere sobered into silence by the mystery. Then the hunter came forward and\\r\\nstood in their midst, and the mystery was solved. They waited in silence while\\r\\nhe skinned the fox, then followed the brush a while, and at length turned off\\r\\ninto the woods again. That evening a Weston Squire came to the Concord\\r\\nhunter’s cottage to inquire for his hounds, and told how for a week they\\r\\nhad been hunting on their own account from Weston woods. The Concord hunter\\r\\ntold him what he knew and offered him the skin; but the other declined it and\\r\\ndeparted. He did not find his hounds that night, but the next day learned that\\r\\nthey had crossed the river and put up at a farm-house for the night, whence,\\r\\nhaving been well fed, they took their departure early in the morning.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe hunter who told me this could remember one Sam Nutting, who used to hunt\\r\\nbears on Fair Haven Ledges, and exchange their skins for rum in Concord\\r\\nvillage; who told him, even, that he had seen a moose there. Nutting had a\\r\\nfamous fox-hound named Burgoyne,—he pronounced it Bugine,—which my\\r\\ninformant used to borrow. In the “Wast Book” of an old trader of\\r\\nthis town, who was also a captain, town-clerk, and representative, I find the\\r\\nfollowing entry. Jan. 18th, 1742â\\x80\\x933, “John Melven Cr. by 1 Grey Fox\\r\\n0—2—3;” they are not now found here; and in his ledger, Feb.\\r\\n7th, 1743, Hezekiah Stratton has credit “by Â½ a Catt skin\\r\\n0—1—4Â½;” of course, a wild-cat, for Stratton was a sergeant\\r\\nin the old French war, and would not have got credit for hunting less noble\\r\\ngame. Credit is given for deer skins also, and they were daily sold. One man\\r\\nstill preserves the horns of the last deer that was killed in this vicinity,\\r\\nand another has told me the particulars of the hunt in which his uncle was\\r\\nengaged. The hunters were formerly a numerous and merry crew here. I remember\\r\\nwell one gaunt Nimrod who would catch up a leaf by the road-side and play a\\r\\nstrain on it wilder and more melodious, if my memory serves me, than any\\r\\nhunting-horn.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt midnight, when there was a moon, I sometimes met with hounds in my path\\r\\nprowling about the woods, which would skulk out of my way, as if afraid, and\\r\\nstand silent amid the bushes till I had passed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSquirrels and wild mice disputed for my store of nuts. There were scores of\\r\\npitch-pines around my house, from one to four inches in diameter, which had\\r\\nbeen gnawed by mice the previous winter,—a Norwegian winter for them, for\\r\\nthe snow lay long and deep, and they were obliged to mix a large proportion of\\r\\npine bark with their other diet. These trees were alive and apparently\\r\\nflourishing at mid-summer, and many of them had grown a foot, though completely\\r\\ngirdled; but after another winter such were without exception dead. It is\\r\\nremarkable that a single mouse should thus be allowed a whole pine tree for its\\r\\ndinner, gnawing round instead of up and down it; but perhaps it is necessary in\\r\\norder to thin these trees, which are wont to grow up densely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe hares (Lepus Americanus) were very familiar. One had her form under\\r\\nmy house all winter, separated from me only by the flooring, and she startled\\r\\nme each morning by her hasty departure when I began to stir,—thump, thump,\\r\\nthump, striking her head against the floor timbers in her hurry. They used to\\r\\ncome round my door at dusk to nibble the potato parings which I had thrown out,\\r\\nand were so nearly the color of the ground that they could hardly be\\r\\ndistinguished when still. Sometimes in the twilight I alternately lost and\\r\\nrecovered sight of one sitting motionless under my window. When I opened my\\r\\ndoor in the evening, off they would go with a squeak and a bounce. Near at hand\\r\\nthey only excited my pity. One evening one sat by my door two paces from me, at\\r\\nfirst trembling with fear, yet unwilling to move; a poor wee thing, lean and\\r\\nbony, with ragged ears and sharp nose, scant tail and slender paws. It looked\\r\\nas if Nature no longer contained the breed of nobler bloods, but stood on her\\r\\nlast toes. Its large eyes appeared young and unhealthy, almost dropsical. I\\r\\ntook a step, and lo, away it scud with an elastic spring over the snow crust,\\r\\nstraightening its body and its limbs into graceful length, and soon put the\\r\\nforest between me and itself,—the wild free venison, asserting its vigor\\r\\nand the dignity of Nature. Not without reason was its slenderness. Such then\\r\\nwas its nature. (Lepus, levipes, light-foot, some think.)\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhat is a country without rabbits and partridges? They are among the most\\r\\nsimple and indigenous animal products; ancient and venerable families known to\\r\\nantiquity as to modern times; of the very hue and substance of Nature, nearest\\r\\nallied to leaves and to the ground,—and to one another; it is either\\r\\nwinged or it is legged. It is hardly as if you had seen a wild creature when a\\r\\nrabbit or a partridge bursts away, only a natural one, as much to be expected\\r\\nas rustling leaves. The partridge and the rabbit are still sure to thrive, like\\r\\ntrue natives of the soil, whatever revolutions occur. If the forest is cut off,\\r\\nthe sprouts and bushes which spring up afford them concealment, and they become\\r\\nmore numerous than ever. That must be a poor country indeed that does not\\r\\nsupport a hare. Our woods teem with them both, and around every swamp may be\\r\\nseen the partridge or rabbit walk, beset with twiggy fences and horse-hair\\r\\nsnares, which some cow-boy tends.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The Pond in Winter\\n\\r\\nAfter a still winter night I awoke with the impression that some question had\\r\\nbeen put to me, which I had been endeavoring in vain to answer in my sleep, as\\r\\nwhat—how—when—where? But there was dawning Nature, in whom\\r\\nall creatures live, looking in at my broad windows with serene and satisfied\\r\\nface, and no question on her lips. I awoke to an answered question, to\\r\\nNature and daylight. The snow lying deep on the earth dotted with young pines,\\r\\nand the very slope of the hill on which my house is placed, seemed to say,\\r\\nForward! Nature puts no question and answers none which we mortals ask. She has\\r\\nlong ago taken her resolution. “O Prince, our eyes contemplate with\\r\\nadmiration and transmit to the soul the wonderful and varied spectacle of this\\r\\nuniverse. The night veils without doubt a part of this glorious creation; but\\r\\nday comes to reveal to us this great work, which extends from earth even into\\r\\nthe plains of the ether.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen to my morning work. First I take an axe and pail and go in search of\\r\\nwater, if that be not a dream. After a cold and snowy night it needed a\\r\\ndivining rod to find it. Every winter the liquid and trembling surface of the\\r\\npond, which was so sensitive to every breath, and reflected every light and\\r\\nshadow, becomes solid to the depth of a foot or a foot and a half, so that it\\r\\nwill support the heaviest teams, and perchance the snow covers it to an equal\\r\\ndepth, and it is not to be distinguished from any level field. Like the marmots\\r\\nin the surrounding hills, it closes its eye-lids and becomes dormant for three\\r\\nmonths or more. Standing on the snow-covered plain, as if in a pasture amid the\\r\\nhills, I cut my way first through a foot of snow, and then a foot of ice, and\\r\\nopen a window under my feet, where, kneeling to drink, I look down into the\\r\\nquiet parlor of the fishes, pervaded by a softened light as through a window of\\r\\nground glass, with its bright sanded floor the same as in summer; there a\\r\\nperennial waveless serenity reigns as in the amber twilight sky, corresponding\\r\\nto the cool and even temperament of the inhabitants. Heaven is under our feet\\r\\nas well as over our heads.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning, while all things are crisp with frost, men come with\\r\\nfishing reels and slender lunch, and let down their fine lines through the\\r\\nsnowy field to take pickerel and perch; wild men, who instinctively follow\\r\\nother fashions and trust other authorities than their townsmen, and by their\\r\\ngoings and comings stitch towns together in parts where else they would be\\r\\nripped. They sit and eat their luncheon in stout fear-naughts on the dry oak\\r\\nleaves on the shore, as wise in natural lore as the citizen is in artificial.\\r\\nThey never consulted with books, and know and can tell much less than they have\\r\\ndone. The things which they practise are said not yet to be known. Here is one\\r\\nfishing for pickerel with grown perch for bait. You look into his pail with\\r\\nwonder as into a summer pond, as if he kept summer locked up at home, or knew\\r\\nwhere she had retreated. How, pray, did he get these in mid-winter? O, he got\\r\\nworms out of rotten logs since the ground froze, and so he caught them. His\\r\\nlife itself passes deeper in Nature than the studies of the naturalist\\r\\npenetrate; himself a subject for the naturalist. The latter raises the moss and\\r\\nbark gently with his knife in search of insects; the former lays open logs to\\r\\ntheir core with his axe, and moss and bark fly far and wide. He gets his living\\r\\nby barking trees. Such a man has some right to fish, and I love to see Nature\\r\\ncarried out in him. The perch swallows the grub-worm, the pickerel swallows the\\r\\nperch, and the fisher-man swallows the pickerel; and so all the chinks in the\\r\\nscale of being are filled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I strolled around the pond in misty weather I was sometimes amused by the\\r\\nprimitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted. He would perhaps have\\r\\nplaced alder branches over the narrow holes in the ice, which were four or five\\r\\nrods apart and an equal distance from the shore, and having fastened the end of\\r\\nthe line to a stick to prevent its being pulled through, have passed the slack\\r\\nline over a twig of the alder, a foot or more above the ice, and tied a dry oak\\r\\nleaf to it, which, being pulled down, would show when he had a bite. These\\r\\nalders loomed through the mist at regular intervals as you walked half way\\r\\nround the pond.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAh, the pickerel of Walden! when I see them lying on the ice, or in the well\\r\\nwhich the fisherman cuts in the ice, making a little hole to admit the water, I\\r\\nam always surprised by their rare beauty, as if they were fabulous fishes, they\\r\\nare so foreign to the streets, even to the woods, foreign as Arabia to our\\r\\nConcord life. They possess a quite dazzling and transcendent beauty which\\r\\nseparates them by a wide interval from the cadaverous cod and haddock whose\\r\\nfame is trumpeted in our streets. They are not green like the pines, nor gray\\r\\nlike the stones, nor blue like the sky; but they have, to my eyes, if possible,\\r\\nyet rarer colors, like flowers and precious stones, as if they were the pearls,\\r\\nthe animalized nuclei or crystals of the Walden water. They, of course,\\r\\nare Walden all over and all through; are themselves small Waldens in the animal\\r\\nkingdom, Waldenses. It is surprising that they are caught here,—that in\\r\\nthis deep and capacious spring, far beneath the rattling teams and chaises and\\r\\ntinkling sleighs that travel the Walden road, this great gold and emerald fish\\r\\nswims. I never chanced to see its kind in any market; it would be the cynosure\\r\\nof all eyes there. Easily, with a few convulsive quirks, they give up their\\r\\nwatery ghosts, like a mortal translated before his time to the thin air of\\r\\nheaven.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I was desirous to recover the long lost bottom of Walden Pond, I surveyed it\\r\\ncarefully, before the ice broke up, early in ’46, with compass and chain\\r\\nand sounding line. There have been many stories told about the bottom, or\\r\\nrather no bottom, of this pond, which certainly had no foundation for\\r\\nthemselves. It is remarkable how long men will believe in the bottomlessness of\\r\\na pond without taking the trouble to sound it. I have visited two such\\r\\nBottomless Ponds in one walk in this neighborhood. Many have believed that\\r\\nWalden reached quite through to the other side of the globe. Some who have lain\\r\\nflat on the ice for a long time, looking down through the illusive medium,\\r\\nperchance with watery eyes into the bargain, and driven to hasty conclusions by\\r\\nthe fear of catching cold in their breasts, have seen vast holes “into\\r\\nwhich a load of hay might be driven,” if there were any body to drive it,\\r\\nthe undoubted source of the Styx and entrance to the Infernal Regions from\\r\\nthese parts. Others have gone down from the village with a\\r\\n“fifty-six” and a wagon load of inch rope, but yet have failed to\\r\\nfind any bottom; for while the “fifty-six” was resting by the way,\\r\\nthey were paying out the rope in the vain attempt to fathom their truly\\r\\nimmeasurable capacity for marvellousness. But I can assure my readers that\\r\\nWalden has a reasonably tight bottom at a not unreasonable, though at an\\r\\nunusual, depth. I fathomed it easily with a cod-line and a stone weighing about\\r\\na pound and a half, and could tell accurately when the stone left the bottom,\\r\\nby having to pull so much harder before the water got underneath to help me.\\r\\nThe greatest depth was exactly one hundred and two feet; to which may be added\\r\\nthe five feet which it has risen since, making one hundred and seven. This is a\\r\\nremarkable depth for so small an area; yet not an inch of it can be spared by\\r\\nthe imagination. What if all ponds were shallow? Would it not react on the\\r\\nminds of men? I am thankful that this pond was made deep and pure for a symbol.\\r\\nWhile men believe in the infinite some ponds will be thought to be bottomless.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA factory owner, hearing what depth I had found, thought that it could not be\\r\\ntrue, for, judging from his acquaintance with dams, sand would not lie at so\\r\\nsteep an angle. But the deepest ponds are not so deep in proportion to their\\r\\narea as most suppose, and, if drained, would not leave very remarkable valleys.\\r\\nThey are not like cups between the hills; for this one, which is so unusually\\r\\ndeep for its area, appears in a vertical section through its centre not deeper\\r\\nthan a shallow plate. Most ponds, emptied, would leave a meadow no more hollow\\r\\nthan we frequently see. William Gilpin, who is so admirable in all that relates\\r\\nto landscapes, and usually so correct, standing at the head of Loch Fyne, in\\r\\nScotland, which he describes as “a bay of salt water, sixty or seventy\\r\\nfathoms deep, four miles in breadth,” and about fifty miles long,\\r\\nsurrounded by mountains, observes, “If we could have seen it immediately\\r\\nafter the diluvian crash, or whatever convulsion of Nature occasioned it,\\r\\nbefore the waters gushed in, what a horrid chasm must it have appeared!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo high as heaved the tumid hills, so low\\r\\nDown sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,\\r\\nCapacious bed of waters—.”\\n\\n\\r\\nBut if, using the shortest diameter of Loch Fyne, we apply these proportions to\\r\\nWalden, which, as we have seen, appears already in a vertical section only like\\r\\na shallow plate, it will appear four times as shallow. So much for the\\r\\nincreased horrors of the chasm of Loch Fyne when emptied. No doubt many\\r\\na smiling valley with its stretching cornfields occupies exactly such a\\r\\n“horrid chasm,” from which the waters have receded, though it\\r\\nrequires the insight and the far sight of the geologist to convince the\\r\\nunsuspecting inhabitants of this fact. Often an inquisitive eye may detect the\\r\\nshores of a primitive lake in the low horizon hills, and no subsequent\\r\\nelevation of the plain has been necessary to conceal their history. But it is\\r\\neasiest, as they who work on the highways know, to find the hollows by the\\r\\npuddles after a shower. The amount of it is, the imagination give it the least\\r\\nlicense, dives deeper and soars higher than Nature goes. So, probably, the\\r\\ndepth of the ocean will be found to be very inconsiderable compared with its\\r\\nbreadth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs I sounded through the ice I could determine the shape of the bottom with\\r\\ngreater accuracy than is possible in surveying harbors which do not freeze\\r\\nover, and I was surprised at its general regularity. In the deepest part there\\r\\nare several acres more level than almost any field which is exposed to the sun\\r\\nwind and plough. In one instance, on a line arbitrarily chosen, the depth did\\r\\nnot vary more than one foot in thirty rods; and generally, near the middle, I\\r\\ncould calculate the variation for each one hundred feet in any direction\\r\\nbeforehand within three or four inches. Some are accustomed to speak of deep\\r\\nand dangerous holes even in quiet sandy ponds like this, but the effect of\\r\\nwater under these circumstances is to level all inequalities. The regularity of\\r\\nthe bottom and its conformity to the shores and the range of the neighboring\\r\\nhills were so perfect that a distant promontory betrayed itself in the\\r\\nsoundings quite across the pond, and its direction could be determined by\\r\\nobserving the opposite shore. Cape becomes bar, and plain shoal, and valley and\\r\\ngorge deep water and channel.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I had mapped the pond by the scale of ten rods to an inch, and put down\\r\\nthe soundings, more than a hundred in all, I observed this remarkable\\r\\ncoincidence. Having noticed that the number indicating the greatest depth was\\r\\napparently in the centre of the map, I laid a rule on the map lengthwise, and\\r\\nthen breadthwise, and found, to my surprise, that the line of greatest length\\r\\nintersected the line of greatest breadth exactly at the point of\\r\\ngreatest depth, notwithstanding that the middle is so nearly level, the outline\\r\\nof the pond far from regular, and the extreme length and breadth were got by\\r\\nmeasuring into the coves; and I said to myself, Who knows but this hint would\\r\\nconduct to the deepest part of the ocean as well as of a pond or puddle? Is not\\r\\nthis the rule also for the height of mountains, regarded as the opposite of\\r\\nvalleys? We know that a hill is not highest at its narrowest part.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOf five coves, three, or all which had been sounded, were observed to have a\\r\\nbar quite across their mouths and deeper water within, so that the bay tended\\r\\nto be an expansion of water within the land not only horizontally but\\r\\nvertically, and to form a basin or independent pond, the direction of the two\\r\\ncapes showing the course of the bar. Every harbor on the sea-coast, also, has\\r\\nits bar at its entrance. In proportion as the mouth of the cove was wider\\r\\ncompared with its length, the water over the bar was deeper compared with that\\r\\nin the basin. Given, then, the length and breadth of the cove, and the\\r\\ncharacter of the surrounding shore, and you have almost elements enough to make\\r\\nout a formula for all cases.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn order to see how nearly I could guess, with this experience, at the deepest\\r\\npoint in a pond, by observing the outlines of its surface and the character of\\r\\nits shores alone, I made a plan of White Pond, which contains about forty-one\\r\\nacres, and, like this, has no island in it, nor any visible inlet or outlet;\\r\\nand as the line of greatest breadth fell very near the line of least breadth,\\r\\nwhere two opposite capes approached each other and two opposite bays receded, I\\r\\nventured to mark a point a short distance from the latter line, but still on\\r\\nthe line of greatest length, as the deepest. The deepest part was found to be\\r\\nwithin one hundred feet of this, still farther in the direction to which I had\\r\\ninclined, and was only one foot deeper, namely, sixty feet. Of course, a stream\\r\\nrunning through, or an island in the pond, would make the problem much more\\r\\ncomplicated.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIf we knew all the laws of Nature, we should need only one fact, or the\\r\\ndescription of one actual phenomenon, to infer all the particular results at\\r\\nthat point. Now we know only a few laws, and our result is vitiated, not, of\\r\\ncourse, by any confusion or irregularity in Nature, but by our ignorance of\\r\\nessential elements in the calculation. Our notions of law and harmony are\\r\\ncommonly confined to those instances which we detect; but the harmony which\\r\\nresults from a far greater number of seemingly conflicting, but really\\r\\nconcurring, laws, which we have not detected, is still more wonderful. The\\r\\nparticular laws are as our points of view, as, to the traveller, a mountain\\r\\noutline varies with every step, and it has an infinite number of profiles,\\r\\nthough absolutely but one form. Even when cleft or bored through it is not\\r\\ncomprehended in its entireness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhat I have observed of the pond is no less true in ethics. It is the law of\\r\\naverage. Such a rule of the two diameters not only guides us toward the sun in\\r\\nthe system and the heart in man, but draw lines through the length and breadth\\r\\nof the aggregate of a man’s particular daily behaviors and waves of life\\r\\ninto his coves and inlets, and where they intersect will be the height or depth\\r\\nof his character. Perhaps we need only to know how his shores trend and his\\r\\nadjacent country or circumstances, to infer his depth and concealed bottom. If\\r\\nhe is surrounded by mountainous circumstances, an Achillean shore, whose peaks\\r\\novershadow and are reflected in his bosom, they suggest a corresponding depth\\r\\nin him. But a low and smooth shore proves him shallow on that side. In our\\r\\nbodies, a bold projecting brow falls off to and indicates a corresponding depth\\r\\nof thought. Also there is a bar across the entrance of our every cove, or\\r\\nparticular inclination; each is our harbor for a season, in which we are\\r\\ndetained and partially land-locked. These inclinations are not whimsical\\r\\nusually, but their form, size, and direction are determined by the promontories\\r\\nof the shore, the ancient axes of elevation. When this bar is gradually\\r\\nincreased by storms, tides, or currents, or there is a subsidence of the\\r\\nwaters, so that it reaches to the surface, that which was at first but an\\r\\ninclination in the shore in which a thought was harbored becomes an individual\\r\\nlake, cut off from the ocean, wherein the thought secures its own conditions,\\r\\nchanges, perhaps, from salt to fresh, becomes a sweet sea, dead sea, or a\\r\\nmarsh. At the advent of each individual into this life, may we not suppose that\\r\\nsuch a bar has risen to the surface somewhere? It is true, we are such poor\\r\\nnavigators that our thoughts, for the most part, stand off and on upon a\\r\\nharborless coast, are conversant only with the bights of the bays of poesy, or\\r\\nsteer for the public ports of entry, and go into the dry docks of science,\\r\\nwhere they merely refit for this world, and no natural currents concur to\\r\\nindividualize them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs for the inlet or outlet of Walden, I have not discovered any but rain and\\r\\nsnow and evaporation, though perhaps, with a thermometer and a line, such\\r\\nplaces may be found, for where the water flows into the pond it will probably\\r\\nbe coldest in summer and warmest in winter. When the ice-men were at work here\\r\\nin ’46â\\x80\\x937, the cakes sent to the shore were one day rejected by those who\\r\\nwere stacking them up there, not being thick enough to lie side by side with\\r\\nthe rest; and the cutters thus discovered that the ice over a small space was\\r\\ntwo or three inches thinner than elsewhere, which made them think that there\\r\\nwas an inlet there. They also showed me in another place what they thought was\\r\\na “leach hole,” through which the pond leaked out under a hill into\\r\\na neighboring meadow, pushing me out on a cake of ice to see it. It was a small\\r\\ncavity under ten feet of water; but I think that I can warrant the pond not to\\r\\nneed soldering till they find a worse leak than that. One has suggested, that\\r\\nif such a “leach hole” should be found, its connection with the\\r\\nmeadow, if any existed, might be proved by conveying some colored powder or\\r\\nsawdust to the mouth of the hole, and then putting a strainer over the spring\\r\\nin the meadow, which would catch some of the particles carried through by the\\r\\ncurrent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile I was surveying, the ice, which was sixteen inches thick, undulated under\\r\\na slight wind like water. It is well known that a level cannot be used on ice.\\r\\nAt one rod from the shore its greatest fluctuation, when observed by means of a\\r\\nlevel on land directed toward a graduated staff on the ice, was three quarters\\r\\nof an inch, though the ice appeared firmly attached to the shore. It was\\r\\nprobably greater in the middle. Who knows but if our instruments were delicate\\r\\nenough we might detect an undulation in the crust of the earth? When two legs\\r\\nof my level were on the shore and the third on the ice, and the sights were\\r\\ndirected over the latter, a rise or fall of the ice of an almost infinitesimal\\r\\namount made a difference of several feet on a tree across the pond. When I\\r\\nbegan to cut holes for sounding, there were three or four inches of water on\\r\\nthe ice under a deep snow which had sunk it thus far; but the water began\\r\\nimmediately to run into these holes, and continued to run for two days in deep\\r\\nstreams, which wore away the ice on every side, and contributed essentially, if\\r\\nnot mainly, to dry the surface of the pond; for, as the water ran in, it raised\\r\\nand floated the ice. This was somewhat like cutting a hole in the bottom of a\\r\\nship to let the water out. When such holes freeze, and a rain succeeds, and\\r\\nfinally a new freezing forms a fresh smooth ice over all, it is beautifully\\r\\nmottled internally by dark figures, shaped somewhat like a spider’s web,\\r\\nwhat you may call ice rosettes, produced by the channels worn by the water\\r\\nflowing from all sides to a centre. Sometimes, also, when the ice was covered\\r\\nwith shallow puddles, I saw a double shadow of myself, one standing on the head\\r\\nof the other, one on the ice, the other on the trees or hill-side.\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile yet it is cold January, and snow and ice are thick and solid, the prudent\\r\\nlandlord comes from the village to get ice to cool his summer drink;\\r\\nimpressively, even pathetically wise, to foresee the heat and thirst of July\\r\\nnow in January,—wearing a thick coat and mittens! when so many things are\\r\\nnot provided for. It may be that he lays up no treasures in this world which\\r\\nwill cool his summer drink in the next. He cuts and saws the solid pond,\\r\\nunroofs the house of fishes, and carts off their very element and air, held\\r\\nfast by chains and stakes like corded wood, through the favoring winter air, to\\r\\nwintry cellars, to underlie the summer there. It looks like solidified azure,\\r\\nas, far off, it is drawn through the streets. These ice-cutters are a merry\\r\\nrace, full of jest and sport, and when I went among them they were wont to\\r\\ninvite me to saw pit-fashion with them, I standing underneath.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the winter of ’46â\\x80\\x937 there came a hundred men of Hyperborean extraction\\r\\nswoop down on to our pond one morning, with many car-loads of ungainly-looking\\r\\nfarming tools, sleds, ploughs, drill-barrows, turf-knives, spades, saws, rakes,\\r\\nand each man was armed with a double-pointed pike-staff, such as is not\\r\\ndescribed in the New-England Farmer or the Cultivator. I did not know whether\\r\\nthey had come to sow a crop of winter rye, or some other kind of grain recently\\r\\nintroduced from Iceland. As I saw no manure, I judged that they meant to skim\\r\\nthe land, as I had done, thinking the soil was deep and had lain fallow long\\r\\nenough. They said that a gentleman farmer, who was behind the scenes, wanted to\\r\\ndouble his money, which, as I understood, amounted to half a million already;\\r\\nbut in order to cover each one of his dollars with another, he took off the\\r\\nonly coat, ay, the skin itself, of Walden Pond in the midst of a hard winter.\\r\\nThey went to work at once, ploughing, harrowing, rolling, furrowing, in\\r\\nadmirable order, as if they were bent on making this a model farm; but when I\\r\\nwas looking sharp to see what kind of seed they dropped into the furrow, a gang\\r\\nof fellows by my side suddenly began to hook up the virgin mould itself, with a\\r\\npeculiar jerk, clean down to the sand, or rather the water,—for it was a\\r\\nvery springy soil,—indeed all the terra firma there was,—and\\r\\nhaul it away on sleds, and then I guessed that they must be cutting peat in a\\r\\nbog. So they came and went every day, with a peculiar shriek from the\\r\\nlocomotive, from and to some point of the polar regions, as it seemed to me,\\r\\nlike a flock of arctic snow-birds. But sometimes Squaw Walden had her revenge,\\r\\nand a hired man, walking behind his team, slipped through a crack in the ground\\r\\ndown toward Tartarus, and he who was so brave before suddenly became but the\\r\\nninth part of a man, almost gave up his animal heat, and was glad to take\\r\\nrefuge in my house, and acknowledged that there was some virtue in a stove; or\\r\\nsometimes the frozen soil took a piece of steel out of a ploughshare, or a\\r\\nplough got set in the furrow and had to be cut out.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo speak literally, a hundred Irishmen, with Yankee overseers, came from\\r\\nCambridge every day to get out the ice. They divided it into cakes by methods\\r\\ntoo well known to require description, and these, being sledded to the shore,\\r\\nwere rapidly hauled off on to an ice platform, and raised by grappling irons\\r\\nand block and tackle, worked by horses, on to a stack, as surely as so many\\r\\nbarrels of flour, and there placed evenly side by side, and row upon row, as if\\r\\nthey formed the solid base of an obelisk designed to pierce the clouds. They\\r\\ntold me that in a good day they could get out a thousand tons, which was the\\r\\nyield of about one acre. Deep ruts and “cradle holes” were worn in\\r\\nthe ice, as on terra firma, by the passage of the sleds over the same\\r\\ntrack, and the horses invariably ate their oats out of cakes of ice hollowed\\r\\nout like buckets. They stacked up the cakes thus in the open air in a pile\\r\\nthirty-five feet high on one side and six or seven rods square, putting hay\\r\\nbetween the outside layers to exclude the air; for when the wind, though never\\r\\nso cold, finds a passage through, it will wear large cavities, leaving slight\\r\\nsupports or studs only here and there, and finally topple it down. At first it\\r\\nlooked like a vast blue fort or Valhalla; but when they began to tuck the\\r\\ncoarse meadow hay into the crevices, and this became covered with rime and\\r\\nicicles, it looked like a venerable moss-grown and hoary ruin, built of\\r\\nazure-tinted marble, the abode of Winter, that old man we see in the\\r\\nalmanac,—his shanty, as if he had a design to estivate with us. They\\r\\ncalculated that not twenty-five per cent of this would reach its destination,\\r\\nand that two or three per cent would be wasted in the cars. However, a still\\r\\ngreater part of this heap had a different destiny from what was intended; for,\\r\\neither because the ice was found not to keep so well as was expected,\\r\\ncontaining more air than usual, or for some other reason, it never got to\\r\\nmarket. This heap, made in the winter of ’46â\\x80\\x937 and estimated to contain\\r\\nten thousand tons, was finally covered with hay and boards; and though it was\\r\\nunroofed the following July, and a part of it carried off, the rest remaining\\r\\nexposed to the sun, it stood over that summer and the next winter, and was not\\r\\nquite melted till September 1848. Thus the pond recovered the greater part.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLike the water, the Walden ice, seen near at hand, has a green tint, but at a\\r\\ndistance is beautifully blue, and you can easily tell it from the white ice of\\r\\nthe river, or the merely greenish ice of some ponds, a quarter of a mile off.\\r\\nSometimes one of those great cakes slips from the ice-man’s sled into the\\r\\nvillage street, and lies there for a week like a great emerald, an object of\\r\\ninterest to all passers. I have noticed that a portion of Walden which in the\\r\\nstate of water was green will often, when frozen, appear from the same point of\\r\\nview blue. So the hollows about this pond will, sometimes, in the winter, be\\r\\nfilled with a greenish water somewhat like its own, but the next day will have\\r\\nfrozen blue. Perhaps the blue color of water and ice is due to the light and\\r\\nair they contain, and the most transparent is the bluest. Ice is an interesting\\r\\nsubject for contemplation. They told me that they had some in the ice-houses at\\r\\nFresh Pond five years old which was as good as ever. Why is it that a bucket of\\r\\nwater soon becomes putrid, but frozen remains sweet forever? It is commonly\\r\\nsaid that this is the difference between the affections and the intellect.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus for sixteen days I saw from my window a hundred men at work like busy\\r\\nhusbandmen, with teams and horses and apparently all the implements of farming,\\r\\nsuch a picture as we see on the first page of the almanac; and as often as I\\r\\nlooked out I was reminded of the fable of the lark and the reapers, or the\\r\\nparable of the sower, and the like; and now they are all gone, and in thirty\\r\\ndays more, probably, I shall look from the same window on the pure sea-green\\r\\nWalden water there, reflecting the clouds and the trees, and sending up its\\r\\nevaporations in solitude, and no traces will appear that a man has ever stood\\r\\nthere. Perhaps I shall hear a solitary loon laugh as he dives and plumes\\r\\nhimself, or shall see a lonely fisher in his boat, like a floating leaf,\\r\\nbeholding his form reflected in the waves, where lately a hundred men securely\\r\\nlabored.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus it appears that the sweltering inhabitants of Charleston and New Orleans,\\r\\nof Madras and Bombay and Calcutta, drink at my well. In the morning I bathe my\\r\\nintellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta,\\r\\nsince whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with\\r\\nwhich our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if\\r\\nthat philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so\\r\\nremote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my\\r\\nwell for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Bramin, priest of\\r\\nBrahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading\\r\\nthe Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet\\r\\nhis servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate\\r\\ntogether in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred\\r\\nwater of the Ganges. With favoring winds it is wafted past the site of the\\r\\nfabulous islands of Atlantis and the Hesperides, makes the periplus of Hanno,\\r\\nand, floating by Ternate and Tidore and the mouth of the Persian Gulf, melts in\\r\\nthe tropic gales of the Indian seas, and is landed in ports of which Alexander\\r\\nonly heard the names.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Spring\\n\\r\\nThe opening of large tracts by the ice-cutters commonly causes a pond to break\\r\\nup earlier; for the water, agitated by the wind, even in cold weather, wears\\r\\naway the surrounding ice. But such was not the effect on Walden that year, for\\r\\nshe had soon got a thick new garment to take the place of the old. This pond\\r\\nnever breaks up so soon as the others in this neighborhood, on account both of\\r\\nits greater depth and its having no stream passing through it to melt or wear\\r\\naway the ice. I never knew it to open in the course of a winter, not excepting\\r\\nthat of ’52â\\x80\\x933, which gave the ponds so severe a trial. It commonly opens\\r\\nabout the first of April, a week or ten days later than Flint’s Pond and\\r\\nFair-Haven, beginning to melt on the north side and in the shallower parts\\r\\nwhere it began to freeze. It indicates better than any water hereabouts the\\r\\nabsolute progress of the season, being least affected by transient changes of\\r\\ntemperature. A severe cold of a few days’ duration in March may very much\\r\\nretard the opening of the former ponds, while the temperature of Walden\\r\\nincreases almost uninterruptedly. A thermometer thrust into the middle of\\r\\nWalden on the 6th of March, 1847, stood at 32°, or freezing point; near the\\r\\nshore at 33°; in the middle of Flint’s Pond, the same day, at\\r\\n32½°; at a dozen rods from the shore, in shallow water, under ice a\\r\\nfoot thick, at 36°. This difference of three and a half degrees between the\\r\\ntemperature of the deep water and the shallow in the latter pond, and the fact\\r\\nthat a great proportion of it is comparatively shallow, show why it should\\r\\nbreak up so much sooner than Walden. The ice in the shallowest part was at this\\r\\ntime several inches thinner than in the middle. In mid-winter the middle had\\r\\nbeen the warmest and the ice thinnest there. So, also, every one who has waded\\r\\nabout the shores of the pond in summer must have perceived how much warmer the\\r\\nwater is close to the shore, where only three or four inches deep, than a\\r\\nlittle distance out, and on the surface where it is deep, than near the bottom.\\r\\nIn spring the sun not only exerts an influence through the increased\\r\\ntemperature of the air and earth, but its heat passes through ice a foot or\\r\\nmore thick, and is reflected from the bottom in shallow water, and so also\\r\\nwarms the water and melts the under side of the ice, at the same time that it\\r\\nis melting it more directly above, making it uneven, and causing the air\\r\\nbubbles which it contains to extend themselves upward and downward until it is\\r\\ncompletely honeycombed, and at last disappears suddenly in a single spring\\r\\nrain. Ice has its grain as well as wood, and when a cake begins to rot or\\r\\n“comb,” that is, assume the appearance of honey-comb, whatever may\\r\\nbe its position, the air cells are at right angles with what was the water\\r\\nsurface. Where there is a rock or a log rising near to the surface the ice over\\r\\nit is much thinner, and is frequently quite dissolved by this reflected heat;\\r\\nand I have been told that in the experiment at Cambridge to freeze water in a\\r\\nshallow wooden pond, though the cold air circulated underneath, and so had\\r\\naccess to both sides, the reflection of the sun from the bottom more than\\r\\ncounterbalanced this advantage. When a warm rain in the middle of the winter\\r\\nmelts off the snow-ice from Walden, and leaves a hard dark or transparent ice\\r\\non the middle, there will be a strip of rotten though thicker white ice, a rod\\r\\nor more wide, about the shores, created by this reflected heat. Also, as I have\\r\\nsaid, the bubbles themselves within the ice operate as burning-glasses to melt\\r\\nthe ice beneath.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe phenomena of the year take place every day in a pond on a small scale.\\r\\nEvery morning, generally speaking, the shallow water is being warmed more\\r\\nrapidly than the deep, though it may not be made so warm after all, and every\\r\\nevening it is being cooled more rapidly until the morning. The day is an\\r\\nepitome of the year. The night is the winter, the morning and evening are the\\r\\nspring and fall, and the noon is the summer. The cracking and booming of the\\r\\nice indicate a change of temperature. One pleasant morning after a cold night,\\r\\nFebruary 24th, 1850, having gone to Flint’s Pond to spend the day, I\\r\\nnoticed with surprise, that when I struck the ice with the head of my axe, it\\r\\nresounded like a gong for many rods around, or as if I had struck on a tight\\r\\ndrum-head. The pond began to boom about an hour after sunrise, when it felt the\\r\\ninfluence of the sun’s rays slanted upon it from over the hills; it\\r\\nstretched itself and yawned like a waking man with a gradually increasing\\r\\ntumult, which was kept up three or four hours. It took a short siesta at noon,\\r\\nand boomed once more toward night, as the sun was withdrawing his influence. In\\r\\nthe right stage of the weather a pond fires its evening gun with great\\r\\nregularity. But in the middle of the day, being full of cracks, and the air\\r\\nalso being less elastic, it had completely lost its resonance, and probably\\r\\nfishes and muskrats could not then have been stunned by a blow on it. The\\r\\nfishermen say that the “thundering of the pond” scares the fishes\\r\\nand prevents their biting. The pond does not thunder every evening, and I\\r\\ncannot tell surely when to expect its thundering; but though I may perceive no\\r\\ndifference in the weather, it does. Who would have suspected so large and cold\\r\\nand thick-skinned a thing to be so sensitive? Yet it has its law to which it\\r\\nthunders obedience when it should as surely as the buds expand in the spring.\\r\\nThe earth is all alive and covered with papillÃ¦. The largest pond is as\\r\\nsensitive to atmospheric changes as the globule of mercury in its tube.\\n\\n\\r\\nOne attraction in coming to the woods to live was that I should have leisure\\r\\nand opportunity to see the spring come in. The ice in the pond at length begins\\r\\nto be honey-combed, and I can set my heel in it as I walk. Fogs and rains and\\r\\nwarmer suns are gradually melting the snow; the days have grown sensibly\\r\\nlonger; and I see how I shall get through the winter without adding to my\\r\\nwood-pile, for large fires are no longer necessary. I am on the alert for the\\r\\nfirst signs of spring, to hear the chance note of some arriving bird, or the\\r\\nstriped squirrel’s chirp, for his stores must be now nearly exhausted, or\\r\\nsee the woodchuck venture out of his winter quarters. On the 13th of March,\\r\\nafter I had heard the bluebird, song-sparrow, and red-wing, the ice was still\\r\\nnearly a foot thick. As the weather grew warmer it was not sensibly worn away\\r\\nby the water, nor broken up and floated off as in rivers, but, though it was\\r\\ncompletely melted for half a rod in width about the shore, the middle was\\r\\nmerely honey-combed and saturated with water, so that you could put your foot\\r\\nthrough it when six inches thick; but by the next day evening, perhaps, after a\\r\\nwarm rain followed by fog, it would have wholly disappeared, all gone off with\\r\\nthe fog, spirited away. One year I went across the middle only five days before\\r\\nit disappeared entirely. In 1845 Walden was first completely open on the 1st of\\r\\nApril; in ’46, the 25th of March; in ’47, the 8th of April; in\\r\\n’51, the 28th of March; in ’52, the 18th of April; in ’53,\\r\\nthe 23d of March; in ’54, about the 7th of April.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEvery incident connected with the breaking up of the rivers and ponds and the\\r\\nsettling of the weather is particularly interesting to us who live in a climate\\r\\nof so great extremes. When the warmer days come, they who dwell near the river\\r\\nhear the ice crack at night with a startling whoop as loud as artillery, as if\\r\\nits icy fetters were rent from end to end, and within a few days see it rapidly\\r\\ngoing out. So the alligator comes out of the mud with quakings of the earth.\\r\\nOne old man, who has been a close observer of Nature, and seems as thoroughly\\r\\nwise in regard to all her operations as if she had been put upon the stocks\\r\\nwhen he was a boy, and he had helped to lay her keel,—who has come to his\\r\\ngrowth, and can hardly acquire more of natural lore if he should live to the\\r\\nage of Methuselah,—told me, and I was surprised to hear him express\\r\\nwonder at any of Nature’s operations, for I thought that there were no\\r\\nsecrets between them, that one spring day he took his gun and boat, and thought\\r\\nthat he would have a little sport with the ducks. There was ice still on the\\r\\nmeadows, but it was all gone out of the river, and he dropped down without\\r\\nobstruction from Sudbury, where he lived, to Fair-Haven Pond, which he found,\\r\\nunexpectedly, covered for the most part with a firm field of ice. It was a warm\\r\\nday, and he was surprised to see so great a body of ice remaining. Not seeing\\r\\nany ducks, he hid his boat on the north or back side of an island in the pond,\\r\\nand then concealed himself in the bushes on the south side, to await them. The\\r\\nice was melted for three or four rods from the shore, and there was a smooth\\r\\nand warm sheet of water, with a muddy bottom, such as the ducks love, within,\\r\\nand he thought it likely that some would be along pretty soon. After he had\\r\\nlain still there about an hour he heard a low and seemingly very distant sound,\\r\\nbut singularly grand and impressive, unlike any thing he had ever heard,\\r\\ngradually swelling and increasing as if it would have a universal and memorable\\r\\nending, a sullen rush and roar, which seemed to him all at once like the sound\\r\\nof a vast body of fowl coming in to settle there, and, seizing his gun, he\\r\\nstarted up in haste and excited; but he found, to his surprise, that the whole\\r\\nbody of the ice had started while he lay there, and drifted in to the shore,\\r\\nand the sound he had heard was made by its edge grating on the shore,—at\\r\\nfirst gently nibbled and crumbled off, but at length heaving up and scattering\\r\\nits wrecks along the island to a considerable height before it came to a stand\\r\\nstill.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt length the sun’s rays have attained the right angle, and warm winds\\r\\nblow up mist and rain and melt the snow banks, and the sun dispersing the mist\\r\\nsmiles on a checkered landscape of russet and white smoking with incense,\\r\\nthrough which the traveller picks his way from islet to islet, cheered by the\\r\\nmusic of a thousand tinkling rills and rivulets whose veins are filled with the\\r\\nblood of winter which they are bearing off.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFew phenomena gave me more delight than to observe the forms which thawing sand\\r\\nand clay assume in flowing down the sides of a deep cut on the railroad through\\r\\nwhich I passed on my way to the village, a phenomenon not very common on so\\r\\nlarge a scale, though the number of freshly exposed banks of the right material\\r\\nmust have been greatly multiplied since railroads were invented. The material\\r\\nwas sand of every degree of fineness and of various rich colors, commonly mixed\\r\\nwith a little clay. When the frost comes out in the spring, and even in a\\r\\nthawing day in the winter, the sand begins to flow down the slopes like lava,\\r\\nsometimes bursting out through the snow and overflowing it where no sand was to\\r\\nbe seen before. Innumerable little streams overlap and interlace one with\\r\\nanother, exhibiting a sort of hybrid product, which obeys half way the law of\\r\\ncurrents, and half way that of vegetation. As it flows it takes the forms of\\r\\nsappy leaves or vines, making heaps of pulpy sprays a foot or more in depth,\\r\\nand resembling, as you look down on them, the laciniated, lobed, and imbricated\\r\\nthalluses of some lichens; or you are reminded of coral, of leopard’s\\r\\npaws or birds’ feet, of brains or lungs or bowels, and excrements of all\\r\\nkinds. It is a truly grotesque vegetation, whose forms and color we see\\r\\nimitated in bronze, a sort of architectural foliage more ancient and typical\\r\\nthan acanthus, chiccory, ivy, vine, or any vegetable leaves; destined perhaps,\\r\\nunder some circumstances, to become a puzzle to future geologists. The whole\\r\\ncut impressed me as if it were a cave with its stalactites laid open to the\\r\\nlight. The various shades of the sand are singularly rich and agreeable,\\r\\nembracing the different iron colors, brown, gray, yellowish, and reddish. When\\r\\nthe flowing mass reaches the drain at the foot of the bank it spreads out\\r\\nflatter into strands, the separate streams losing their semi-cylindrical\\r\\nform and gradually becoming more flat and broad, running together as they are\\r\\nmore moist, till they form an almost flat sand, still variously and\\r\\nbeautifully shaded, but in which you can trace the original forms of\\r\\nvegetation; till at length, in the water itself, they are converted into\\r\\nbanks, like those formed off the mouths of rivers, and the forms of\\r\\nvegetation are lost in the ripple marks on the bottom.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe whole bank, which is from twenty to forty feet high, is sometimes overlaid\\r\\nwith a mass of this kind of foliage, or sandy rupture, for a quarter of a mile\\r\\non one or both sides, the produce of one spring day. What makes this sand\\r\\nfoliage remarkable is its springing into existence thus suddenly. When I see on\\r\\nthe one side the inert bank,—for the sun acts on one side\\r\\nfirst,—and on the other this luxuriant foliage, the creation of an hour,\\r\\nI am affected as if in a peculiar sense I stood in the laboratory of the Artist\\r\\nwho made the world and me,—had come to where he was still at work,\\r\\nsporting on this bank, and with excess of energy strewing his fresh designs\\r\\nabout. I feel as if I were nearer to the vitals of the globe, for this sandy\\r\\noverflow is something such a foliaceous mass as the vitals of the animal body.\\r\\nYou find thus in the very sands an anticipation of the vegetable leaf. No\\r\\nwonder that the earth expresses itself outwardly in leaves, it so labors with\\r\\nthe idea inwardly. The atoms have already learned this law, and are pregnant by\\r\\nit. The overhanging leaf sees here its prototype. Internally, whether in\\r\\nthe globe or animal body, it is a moist thick lobe, a word especially\\r\\napplicable to the liver and lungs and the leaves of fat,\\r\\n(λείβω, labor, lapsus, to flow or slip\\r\\ndownward, a lapsing; λοβος, globus, lobe,\\r\\nglobe; also lap, flap, and many other words,) externally a dry thin\\r\\nleaf, even as the f and v are a pressed and dried\\r\\nb. The radicals of lobe are lb, the soft mass of the\\r\\nb (single lobed, or B, double lobed,) with the liquid l behind it\\r\\npressing it forward. In globe, glb, the guttural g adds to the\\r\\nmeaning the capacity of the throat. The feathers and wings of birds are still\\r\\ndrier and thinner leaves. Thus, also, you pass from the lumpish grub in the\\r\\nearth to the airy and fluttering butterfly. The very globe continually\\r\\ntranscends and translates itself, and becomes winged in its orbit. Even ice\\r\\nbegins with delicate crystal leaves, as if it had flowed into moulds which the\\r\\nfronds of water plants have impressed on the watery mirror. The whole tree\\r\\nitself is but one leaf, and rivers are still vaster leaves whose pulp is\\r\\nintervening earth, and towns and cities are the ova of insects in their axils.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the sun withdraws the sand ceases to flow, but in the morning the streams\\r\\nwill start once more and branch and branch again into a myriad of others. You\\r\\nhere see perchance how blood vessels are formed. If you look closely you\\r\\nobserve that first there pushes forward from the thawing mass a stream of\\r\\nsoftened sand with a drop-like point, like the ball of the finger, feeling its\\r\\nway slowly and blindly downward, until at last with more heat and moisture, as\\r\\nthe sun gets higher, the most fluid portion, in its effort to obey the law to\\r\\nwhich the most inert also yields, separates from the latter and forms for\\r\\nitself a meandering channel or artery within that, in which is seen a little\\r\\nsilvery stream glancing like lightning from one stage of pulpy leaves or\\r\\nbranches to another, and ever and anon swallowed up in the sand. It is\\r\\nwonderful how rapidly yet perfectly the sand organizes itself as it flows,\\r\\nusing the best material its mass affords to form the sharp edges of its\\r\\nchannel. Such are the sources of rivers. In the silicious matter which the\\r\\nwater deposits is perhaps the bony system, and in the still finer soil and\\r\\norganic matter the fleshy fibre or cellular tissue. What is man but a mass of\\r\\nthawing clay? The ball of the human finger is but a drop congealed. The fingers\\r\\nand toes flow to their extent from the thawing mass of the body. Who knows what\\r\\nthe human body would expand and flow out to under a more genial heaven? Is not\\r\\nthe hand a spreading palm leaf with its lobes and veins? The ear may be\\r\\nregarded, fancifully, as a lichen, umbilicaria, on the side of the head,\\r\\nwith its lobe or drop. The lip—labium, from labor\\r\\n(?)—laps or lapses from the sides of the cavernous mouth. The nose is a\\r\\nmanifest congealed drop or stalactite. The chin is a still larger drop, the\\r\\nconfluent dripping of the face. The cheeks are a slide from the brows into the\\r\\nvalley of the face, opposed and diffused by the cheek bones. Each rounded lobe\\r\\nof the vegetable leaf, too, is a thick and now loitering drop, larger or\\r\\nsmaller; the lobes are the fingers of the leaf; and as many lobes as it has, in\\r\\nso many directions it tends to flow, and more heat or other genial influences\\r\\nwould have caused it to flow yet farther.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus it seemed that this one hillside illustrated the principle of all the\\r\\noperations of Nature. The Maker of this earth but patented a leaf. What\\r\\nChampollion will decipher this hieroglyphic for us, that we may turn over a new\\r\\nleaf at last? This phenomenon is more exhilarating to me than the luxuriance\\r\\nand fertility of vineyards. True, it is somewhat excrementitious in its\\r\\ncharacter, and there is no end to the heaps of liver lights and bowels, as if\\r\\nthe globe were turned wrong side outward; but this suggests at least that\\r\\nNature has some bowels, and there again is mother of humanity. This is the\\r\\nfrost coming out of the ground; this is Spring. It precedes the green and\\r\\nflowery spring, as mythology precedes regular poetry. I know of nothing more\\r\\npurgative of winter fumes and indigestions. It convinces me that Earth is still\\r\\nin her swaddling clothes, and stretches forth baby fingers on every side. Fresh\\r\\ncurls spring from the baldest brow. There is nothing inorganic. These\\r\\nfoliaceous heaps lie along the bank like the slag of a furnace, showing that\\r\\nNature is “in full blast” within. The earth is not a mere fragment\\r\\nof dead history, stratum upon stratum like the leaves of a book, to be studied\\r\\nby geologists and antiquaries chiefly, but living poetry like the leaves of a\\r\\ntree, which precede flowers and fruit,—not a fossil earth, but a living\\r\\nearth; compared with whose great central life all animal and vegetable life is\\r\\nmerely parasitic. Its throes will heave our exuviÃ¦ from their graves. You may\\r\\nmelt your metals and cast them into the most beautiful moulds you can; they\\r\\nwill never excite me like the forms which this molten earth flows out into. And\\r\\nnot only it, but the institutions upon it, are plastic like clay in the hands\\r\\nof the potter.\\n\\n\\r\\nEre long, not only on these banks, but on every hill and plain and in every\\r\\nhollow, the frost comes out of the ground like a dormant quadruped from its\\r\\nburrow, and seeks the sea with music, or migrates to other climes in clouds.\\r\\nThaw with his gentle persuasion is more powerful than Thor with his hammer. The\\r\\none melts, the other but breaks in pieces.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the ground was partially bare of snow, and a few warm days had dried its\\r\\nsurface somewhat, it was pleasant to compare the first tender signs of the\\r\\ninfant year just peeping forth with the stately beauty of the withered\\r\\nvegetation which had withstood the winter,—life-everlasting, golden-rods,\\r\\npinweeds, and graceful wild grasses, more obvious and interesting frequently\\r\\nthan in summer even, as if their beauty was not ripe till then; even\\r\\ncotton-grass, cat-tails, mulleins, johnswort, hard-hack, meadow-sweet, and\\r\\nother strong stemmed plants, those unexhausted granaries which entertain the\\r\\nearliest birds,—decent weeds, at least, which widowed Nature wears. I am\\r\\nparticularly attracted by the arching and sheaf-like top of the wool-grass; it\\r\\nbrings back the summer to our winter memories, and is among the forms which art\\r\\nloves to copy, and which, in the vegetable kingdom, have the same relation to\\r\\ntypes already in the mind of man that astronomy has. It is an antique style\\r\\nolder than Greek or Egyptian. Many of the phenomena of Winter are suggestive of\\r\\nan inexpressible tenderness and fragile delicacy. We are accustomed to hear\\r\\nthis king described as a rude and boisterous tyrant; but with the gentleness of\\r\\na lover he adorns the tresses of Summer.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt the approach of spring the red-squirrels got under my house, two at a time,\\r\\ndirectly under my feet as I sat reading or writing, and kept up the queerest\\r\\nchuckling and chirruping and vocal pirouetting and gurgling sounds that ever\\r\\nwere heard; and when I stamped they only chirruped the louder, as if past all\\r\\nfear and respect in their mad pranks, defying humanity to stop them. No you\\r\\ndon’t—chickaree—chickaree. They were wholly deaf to my\\r\\narguments, or failed to perceive their force, and fell into a strain of\\r\\ninvective that was irresistible.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe first sparrow of spring! The year beginning with younger hope than ever!\\r\\nThe faint silvery warblings heard over the partially bare and moist fields from\\r\\nthe blue-bird, the song-sparrow, and the red-wing, as if the last flakes of\\r\\nwinter tinkled as they fell! What at such a time are histories, chronologies,\\r\\ntraditions, and all written revelations? The brooks sing carols and glees to\\r\\nthe spring. The marsh-hawk sailing low over the meadow is already seeking the\\r\\nfirst slimy life that awakes. The sinking sound of melting snow is heard in all\\r\\ndells, and the ice dissolves apace in the ponds. The grass flames up on the\\r\\nhillsides like a spring fire,—“et primitus oritur herba imbribus\\r\\nprimoribus evocata,”—as if the earth sent forth an inward heat to\\r\\ngreet the returning sun; not yellow but green is the color of its\\r\\nflame;—the symbol of perpetual youth, the grass-blade, like a long green\\r\\nribbon, streams from the sod into the summer, checked indeed by the frost, but\\r\\nanon pushing on again, lifting its spear of last year’s hay with the\\r\\nfresh life below. It grows as steadily as the rill oozes out of the ground. It\\r\\nis almost identical with that, for in the growing days of June, when the rills\\r\\nare dry, the grass blades are their channels, and from year to year the herds\\r\\ndrink at this perennial green stream, and the mower draws from it betimes their\\r\\nwinter supply. So our human life but dies down to its root, and still puts\\r\\nforth its green blade to eternity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWalden is melting apace. There is a canal two rods wide along the northerly and\\r\\nwesterly sides, and wider still at the east end. A great field of ice has\\r\\ncracked off from the main body. I hear a song-sparrow singing from the bushes\\r\\non the shore,—olit, olit, olit,—chip,\\r\\nchip, chip, che char,—che wiss, wiss,\\r\\nwiss. He too is helping to crack it. How handsome the great sweeping\\r\\ncurves in the edge of the ice, answering somewhat to those of the shore, but\\r\\nmore regular! It is unusually hard, owing to the recent severe but transient\\r\\ncold, and all watered or waved like a palace floor. But the wind slides\\r\\neastward over its opaque surface in vain, till it reaches the living surface\\r\\nbeyond. It is glorious to behold this ribbon of water sparkling in the sun, the\\r\\nbare face of the pond full of glee and youth, as if it spoke the joy of the\\r\\nfishes within it, and of the sands on its shore,—a silvery sheen as from\\r\\nthe scales of a leuciscus, as it were all one active fish. Such is the\\r\\ncontrast between winter and spring. Walden was dead and is alive again. But\\r\\nthis spring it broke up more steadily, as I have said.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe change from storm and winter to serene and mild weather, from dark and\\r\\nsluggish hours to bright and elastic ones, is a memorable crisis which all\\r\\nthings proclaim. It is seemingly instantaneous at last. Suddenly an influx of\\r\\nlight filled my house, though the evening was at hand, and the clouds of winter\\r\\nstill overhung it, and the eaves were dripping with sleety rain. I looked out\\r\\nthe window, and lo! where yesterday was cold gray ice there lay the transparent\\r\\npond already calm and full of hope as in a summer evening, reflecting a summer\\r\\nevening sky in its bosom, though none was visible overhead, as if it had\\r\\nintelligence with some remote horizon. I heard a robin in the distance, the\\r\\nfirst I had heard for many a thousand years, methought, whose note I shall not\\r\\nforget for many a thousand more,—the same sweet and powerful song as of\\r\\nyore. O the evening robin, at the end of a New England summer day! If I could\\r\\never find the twig he sits upon! I mean he; I mean the twig. This\\r\\nat least is not the Turdus migratorius. The pitch-pines and shrub-oaks\\r\\nabout my house, which had so long drooped, suddenly resumed their several\\r\\ncharacters, looked brighter, greener, and more erect and alive, as if\\r\\neffectually cleansed and restored by the rain. I knew that it would not rain\\r\\nany more. You may tell by looking at any twig of the forest, ay, at your very\\r\\nwood-pile, whether its winter is past or not. As it grew darker, I was startled\\r\\nby the honking of geese flying low over the woods, like weary travellers\\r\\ngetting in late from southern lakes, and indulging at last in unrestrained\\r\\ncomplaint and mutual consolation. Standing at my door, I could hear the rush of\\r\\ntheir wings; when, driving toward my house, they suddenly spied my light, and\\r\\nwith hushed clamor wheeled and settled in the pond. So I came in, and shut the\\r\\ndoor, and passed my first spring night in the woods.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the morning I watched the geese from the door through the mist, sailing in\\r\\nthe middle of the pond, fifty rods off, so large and tumultuous that Walden\\r\\nappeared like an artificial pond for their amusement. But when I stood on the\\r\\nshore they at once rose up with a great flapping of wings at the signal of\\r\\ntheir commander, and when they had got into rank circled about over my head,\\r\\ntwenty-nine of them, and then steered straight to Canada, with a regular\\r\\nhonk from the leader at intervals, trusting to break their fast in\\r\\nmuddier pools. A “plump” of ducks rose at the same time and took\\r\\nthe route to the north in the wake of their noisier cousins.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor a week I heard the circling, groping clangor of some solitary goose in the\\r\\nfoggy mornings, seeking its companion, and still peopling the woods with the\\r\\nsound of a larger life than they could sustain. In April the pigeons were seen\\r\\nagain flying express in small flocks, and in due time I heard the martins\\r\\ntwittering over my clearing, though it had not seemed that the township\\r\\ncontained so many that it could afford me any, and I fancied that they were\\r\\npeculiarly of the ancient race that dwelt in hollow trees ere white men came.\\r\\nIn almost all climes the tortoise and the frog are among the precursors and\\r\\nheralds of this season, and birds fly with song and glancing plumage, and\\r\\nplants spring and bloom, and winds blow, to correct this slight oscillation of\\r\\nthe poles and preserve the equilibrium of Nature.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs every season seems best to us in its turn, so the coming in of spring is\\r\\nlike the creation of Cosmos out of Chaos and the realization of the Golden\\r\\nAge.—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eurus ad Auroram NabathÃ¦aque regna recessit,\\r\\nPersidaque, et radiis juga subdita matutinis.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The East-Wind withdrew to Aurora and the NabathÃ¦an kingdom,\\r\\nAnd the Persian, and the ridges placed under the morning rays\\r\\n\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0*Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0*Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0*Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0*\\r\\n\\r\\nMan was born.  Whether that Artificer of things,\\r\\nThe origin of a better world, made him from the divine seed;\\r\\nOr the earth, being recent and lately sundered from the high\\r\\nEther, retained some seeds of cognate heaven.”\\n\\n\\r\\nA single gentle rain makes the grass many shades greener. So our prospects\\r\\nbrighten on the influx of better thoughts. We should be blessed if we lived in\\r\\nthe present always, and took advantage of every accident that befell us, like\\r\\nthe grass which confesses the influence of the slightest dew that falls on it;\\r\\nand did not spend our time in atoning for the neglect of past opportunities,\\r\\nwhich we call doing our duty. We loiter in winter while it is already spring.\\r\\nIn a pleasant spring morning all men’s sins are forgiven. Such a day is a\\r\\ntruce to vice. While such a sun holds out to burn, the vilest sinner may\\r\\nreturn. Through our own recovered innocence we discern the innocence of our\\r\\nneighbors. You may have known your neighbor yesterday for a thief, a drunkard,\\r\\nor a sensualist, and merely pitied or despised him, and despaired of the world;\\r\\nbut the sun shines bright and warm this first spring morning, re-creating the\\r\\nworld, and you meet him at some serene work, and see how his exhausted and\\r\\ndebauched veins expand with still joy and bless the new day, feel the spring\\r\\ninfluence with the innocence of infancy, and all his faults are forgotten.\\r\\nThere is not only an atmosphere of good will about him, but even a savor of\\r\\nholiness groping for expression, blindly and ineffectually perhaps, like a\\r\\nnew-born instinct, and for a short hour the south hill-side echoes to no vulgar\\r\\njest. You see some innocent fair shoots preparing to burst from his gnarled\\r\\nrind and try another year’s life, tender and fresh as the youngest plant.\\r\\nEven he has entered into the joy of his Lord. Why the jailer does not leave\\r\\nopen his prison doors,—why the judge does not dismis his case,—why\\r\\nthe preacher does not dismiss his congregation! It is because they do not obey\\r\\nthe hint which God gives them, nor accept the pardon which he freely offers to\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A return to goodness produced each day in the tranquil and beneficent\\r\\nbreath of the morning, causes that in respect to the love of virtue and the\\r\\nhatred of vice, one approaches a little the primitive nature of man, as the\\r\\nsprouts of the forest which has been felled. In like manner the evil which one\\r\\ndoes in the interval of a day prevents the germs of virtues which began to\\r\\nspring up again from developing themselves and destroys them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After the germs of virtue have thus been prevented many times from\\r\\ndeveloping themselves, then the beneficent breath of evening does not suffice\\r\\nto preserve them. As soon as the breath of evening does not suffice longer to\\r\\npreserve them, then the nature of man does not differ much from that of the\\r\\nbrute. Men seeing the nature of this man like that of the brute, think that he\\r\\nhas never possessed the innate faculty of reason. Are those the true and\\r\\nnatural sentiments of man?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Golden Age was first created, which without any avenger\\r\\nSpontaneously without law cherished fidelity and rectitude.\\r\\nPunishment and fear were not; nor were threatening words read\\r\\nOn suspended brass; nor did the suppliant crowd fear\\r\\nThe words of their judge; but were safe without an avenger.\\r\\nNot yet the pine felled on its mountains had descended\\r\\nTo the liquid waves that it might see a foreign world,\\r\\nAnd mortals knew no shores but their own.\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0*Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0*Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0*Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0*\\r\\nThere was eternal spring, and placid zephyrs with warm\\r\\nBlasts soothed the flowers born without seed.”\\n\\n\\r\\nOn the 29th of April, as I was fishing from the bank of the river near the\\r\\nNine-Acre-Corner bridge, standing on the quaking grass and willow roots, where\\r\\nthe muskrats lurk, I heard a singular rattling sound, somewhat like that of the\\r\\nsticks which boys play with their fingers, when, looking up, I observed a very\\r\\nslight and graceful hawk, like a night-hawk, alternately soaring like a ripple\\r\\nand tumbling a rod or two over and over, showing the underside of its wings,\\r\\nwhich gleamed like a satin ribbon in the sun, or like the pearly inside of a\\r\\nshell. This sight reminded me of falconry and what nobleness and poetry are\\r\\nassociated with that sport. The Merlin it seemed to me it might be called: but\\r\\nI care not for its name. It was the most ethereal flight I had ever witnessed.\\r\\nIt did not simply flutter like a butterfly, nor soar like the larger hawks, but\\r\\nit sported with proud reliance in the fields of air; mounting again and again\\r\\nwith its strange chuckle, it repeated its free and beautiful fall, turning over\\r\\nand over like a kite, and then recovering from its lofty tumbling, as if it had\\r\\nnever set its foot on terra firma. It appeared to have no companion in\\r\\nthe universe,—sporting there alone,—and to need none but the morning\\r\\nand the ether with which it played. It was not lonely, but made all the earth\\r\\nlonely beneath it. Where was the parent which hatched it, its kindred, and its\\r\\nfather in the heavens? The tenant of the air, it seemed related to the earth\\r\\nbut by an egg hatched some time in the crevice of a crag;—or was its\\r\\nnative nest made in the angle of a cloud, woven of the rainbow’s\\r\\ntrimmings and the sunset sky, and lined with some soft midsummer haze caught up\\r\\nfrom earth? Its eyry now some cliffy cloud.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBeside this I got a rare mess of golden and silver and bright cupreous fishes,\\r\\nwhich looked like a string of jewels. Ah! I have penetrated to those meadows on\\r\\nthe morning of many a first spring day, jumping from hummock to hummock, from\\r\\nwillow root to willow root, when the wild river valley and the woods were\\r\\nbathed in so pure and bright a light as would have waked the dead, if they had\\r\\nbeen slumbering in their graves, as some suppose. There needs no stronger proof\\r\\nof immortality. All things must live in such a light. O Death, where was thy\\r\\nsting? O Grave, where was thy victory, then?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur village life would stagnate if it were not for the unexplored forests and\\r\\nmeadows which surround it. We need the tonic of wildness,—to wade\\r\\nsometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hear the\\r\\nbooming of the snipe; to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and\\r\\nmore solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close to\\r\\nthe ground. At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all\\r\\nthings, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land\\r\\nand sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because\\r\\nunfathomable. We can never have enough of Nature. We must be refreshed by the\\r\\nsight of inexhaustible vigor, vast and Titanic features, the sea-coast with its\\r\\nwrecks, the wilderness with its living and its decaying trees, the\\r\\nthunder cloud, and the rain which lasts three weeks and produces freshets. We\\r\\nneed to witness our own limits transgressed, and some life pasturing freely\\r\\nwhere we never wander. We are cheered when we observe the vulture feeding on\\r\\nthe carrion which disgusts and disheartens us and deriving health and strength\\r\\nfrom the repast. There was a dead horse in the hollow by the path to my house,\\r\\nwhich compelled me sometimes to go out of my way, especially in the night when\\r\\nthe air was heavy, but the assurance it gave me of the strong appetite and\\r\\ninviolable health of Nature was my compensation for this. I love to see that\\r\\nNature is so rife with life that myriads can be afforded to be sacrificed and\\r\\nsuffered to prey on one another; that tender organizations can be so serenely\\r\\nsquashed out of existence like pulp,—tadpoles which herons gobble up, and\\r\\ntortoises and toads run over in the road; and that sometimes it has rained\\r\\nflesh and blood! With the liability to accident, we must see how little account\\r\\nis to be made of it. The impression made on a wise man is that of universal\\r\\ninnocence. Poison is not poisonous after all, nor are any wounds fatal.\\r\\nCompassion is a very untenable ground. It must be expeditious. Its pleadings\\r\\nwill not bear to be stereotyped.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEarly in May, the oaks, hickories, maples, and other trees, just putting out\\r\\namidst the pine woods around the pond, imparted a brightness like sunshine to\\r\\nthe landscape, especially in cloudy days, as if the sun were breaking through\\r\\nmists and shining faintly on the hill-sides here and there. On the third or\\r\\nfourth of May I saw a loon in the pond, and during the first week of the month\\r\\nI heard the whippoorwill, the brown-thrasher, the veery, the wood-pewee, the\\r\\nchewink, and other birds. I had heard the wood-thrush long before. The\\r\\nphÅ\\x93be had already come once more and looked in at my door and window, to\\r\\nsee if my house was cavern-like enough for her, sustaining herself on humming\\r\\nwings with clinched talons, as if she held by the air, while she surveyed the\\r\\npremises. The sulphur-like pollen of the pitch-pine soon covered the pond and\\r\\nthe stones and rotten wood along the shore, so that you could have collected a\\r\\nbarrel-ful. This is the “sulphur showers” we hear of. Even in\\r\\nCalidas’ drama of Sacontala, we read of “rills dyed yellow with the\\r\\ngolden dust of the lotus.” And so the seasons went rolling on into\\r\\nsummer, as one rambles into higher and higher grass.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus was my first year’s life in the woods completed; and the second year\\r\\nwas similar to it. I finally left Walden September 6th, 1847.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion\\n\\r\\nTo the sick the doctors wisely recommend a change of air and scenery. Thank\\r\\nHeaven, here is not all the world. The buck-eye does not grow in New England,\\r\\nand the mocking-bird is rarely heard here. The wild-goose is more of a\\r\\ncosmopolite than we; he breaks his fast in Canada, takes a luncheon in the\\r\\nOhio, and plumes himself for the night in a southern bayou. Even the bison, to\\r\\nsome extent, keeps pace with the seasons, cropping the pastures of the Colorado\\r\\nonly till a greener and sweeter grass awaits him by the Yellowstone. Yet we\\r\\nthink that if rail-fences are pulled down, and stone-walls piled up on our\\r\\nfarms, bounds are henceforth set to our lives and our fates decided. If you are\\r\\nchosen town-clerk, forsooth, you cannot go to Tierra del Fuego this summer: but\\r\\nyou may go to the land of infernal fire nevertheless. The universe is wider\\r\\nthan our views of it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYet we should oftener look over the tafferel of our craft, like curious\\r\\npassengers, and not make the voyage like stupid sailors picking oakum. The\\r\\nother side of the globe is but the home of our correspondent. Our voyaging is\\r\\nonly great-circle sailing, and the doctors prescribe for diseases of the skin\\r\\nmerely. One hastens to Southern Africa to chase the giraffe; but surely that is\\r\\nnot the game he would be after. How long, pray, would a man hunt giraffes if he\\r\\ncould? Snipes and woodcocks also may afford rare sport; but I trust it would be\\r\\nnobler game to shoot one’s self.—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Direct your eye right inward, and you’ll find\\r\\nA thousand regions in your mind\\r\\nYet undiscovered. Travel them, and be\\r\\nExpert in home-cosmography.”\\n\\n\\r\\nWhat does Africa,—what does the West stand for? Is not our own interior\\r\\nwhite on the chart? black though it may prove, like the coast, when discovered.\\r\\nIs it the source of the Nile, or the Niger, or the Mississippi, or a North-West\\r\\nPassage around this continent, that we would find? Are these the problems which\\r\\nmost concern mankind? Is Franklin the only man who is lost, that his wife\\r\\nshould be so earnest to find him? Does Mr. Grinnell know where he himself is?\\r\\nBe rather the Mungo Park, the Lewis and Clarke and Frobisher, of your own\\r\\nstreams and oceans; explore your own higher latitudes,—with shiploads of\\r\\npreserved meats to support you, if they be necessary; and pile the empty cans\\r\\nsky-high for a sign. Were preserved meats invented to preserve meat merely?\\r\\nNay, be a Columbus to whole new continents and worlds within you, opening new\\r\\nchannels, not of trade, but of thought. Every man is the lord of a realm beside\\r\\nwhich the earthly empire of the Czar is but a petty state, a hummock left by\\r\\nthe ice. Yet some can be patriotic who have no self-respect, and\\r\\nsacrifice the greater to the less. They love the soil which makes their graves,\\r\\nbut have no sympathy with the spirit which may still animate their clay.\\r\\nPatriotism is a maggot in their heads. What was the meaning of that South-Sea\\r\\nExploring Expedition, with all its parade and expense, but an indirect\\r\\nrecognition of the fact, that there are continents and seas in the moral world\\r\\nto which every man is an isthmus or an inlet, yet unexplored by him, but that\\r\\nit is easier to sail many thousand miles through cold and storm and cannibals,\\r\\nin a government ship, with five hundred men and boys to assist one, than it is\\r\\nto explore the private sea, the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean of one’s being\\r\\nalone.—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Erret, et extremos alter scrutetur Iberos.\\r\\nPlus habet hic vitÃ¦, plus habet ille viÃ¦.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLet them wander and scrutinize the outlandish Australians.\\r\\nI have more of God, they more of the road.\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is not worth the while to go round the world to count the cats in Zanzibar.\\r\\nYet do this even till you can do better, and you may perhaps find some\\r\\n“Symmes’ Hole” by which to get at the inside at last. England\\r\\nand France, Spain and Portugal, Gold Coast and Slave Coast, all front on this\\r\\nprivate sea; but no bark from them has ventured out of sight of land, though it\\r\\nis without doubt the direct way to India. If you would learn to speak all\\r\\ntongues and conform to the customs of all nations, if you would travel farther\\r\\nthan all travellers, be naturalized in all climes, and cause the Sphinx to dash\\r\\nher head against a stone, even obey the precept of the old philosopher, and\\r\\nExplore thyself. Herein are demanded the eye and the nerve. Only the defeated\\r\\nand deserters go to the wars, cowards that run away and enlist. Start now on\\r\\nthat farthest western way, which does not pause at the Mississippi or the\\r\\nPacific, nor conduct toward a worn-out China or Japan, but leads on direct a\\r\\ntangent to this sphere, summer and winter, day and night, sun down, moon down,\\r\\nand at last earth down too.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is said that Mirabeau took to highway robbery “to ascertain what\\r\\ndegree of resolution was necessary in order to place one’s self in formal\\r\\nopposition to the most sacred laws of society.” He declared that “a\\r\\nsoldier who fights in the ranks does not require half so much courage as a\\r\\nfoot-pad,”—“that honor and religion have never stood in the\\r\\nway of a well-considered and a firm resolve.” This was manly, as the\\r\\nworld goes; and yet it was idle, if not desperate. A saner man would have found\\r\\nhimself often enough “in formal opposition” to what are deemed\\r\\n“the most sacred laws of society,” through obedience to yet more\\r\\nsacred laws, and so have tested his resolution without going out of his way. It\\r\\nis not for a man to put himself in such an attitude to society, but to maintain\\r\\nhimself in whatever attitude he find himself through obedience to the laws of\\r\\nhis being, which will never be one of opposition to a just government, if he\\r\\nshould chance to meet with such.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI left the woods for as good a reason as I went there. Perhaps it seemed to me\\r\\nthat I had several more lives to live, and could not spare any more time for\\r\\nthat one. It is remarkable how easily and insensibly we fall into a particular\\r\\nroute, and make a beaten track for ourselves. I had not lived there a week\\r\\nbefore my feet wore a path from my door to the pond-side; and though it is five\\r\\nor six years since I trod it, it is still quite distinct. It is true, I fear\\r\\nthat others may have fallen into it, and so helped to keep it open. The surface\\r\\nof the earth is soft and impressible by the feet of men; and so with the paths\\r\\nwhich the mind travels. How worn and dusty, then, must be the highways of the\\r\\nworld, how deep the ruts of tradition and conformity! I did not wish to take a\\r\\ncabin passage, but rather to go before the mast and on the deck of the world,\\r\\nfor there I could best see the moonlight amid the mountains. I do not wish to\\r\\ngo below now.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI learned this, at least, by my experiment; that if one advances confidently in\\r\\nthe direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has\\r\\nimagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put\\r\\nsome things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more\\r\\nliberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the\\r\\nold laws be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and\\r\\nhe will live with the license of a higher order of beings. In proportion as he\\r\\nsimplifies his life, the laws of the universe will appear less complex, and\\r\\nsolitude will not be solitude, nor poverty poverty, nor weakness weakness. If\\r\\nyou have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where\\r\\nthey should be. Now put the foundations under them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is a ridiculous demand which England and America make, that you shall speak\\r\\nso that they can understand you. Neither men nor toad-stools grow so. As if\\r\\nthat were important, and there were not enough to understand you without them.\\r\\nAs if Nature could support but one order of understandings, could not sustain\\r\\nbirds as well as quadrupeds, flying as well as creeping things, and hush\\r\\nand who, which Bright can understand, were the best English. As if\\r\\nthere were safety in stupidity alone. I fear chiefly lest my expression may not\\r\\nbe extra-vagant enough, may not wander far enough beyond the narrow\\r\\nlimits of my daily experience, so as to be adequate to the truth of which I\\r\\nhave been convinced. Extra vagance! it depends on how you are yarded.\\r\\nThe migrating buffalo, which seeks new pastures in another latitude, is not\\r\\nextravagant like the cow which kicks over the pail, leaps the cow-yard fence,\\r\\nand runs after her calf, in milking time. I desire to speak somewhere\\r\\nwithout bounds; like a man in a waking moment, to men in their waking\\r\\nmoments; for I am convinced that I cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the\\r\\nfoundation of a true expression. Who that has heard a strain of music feared\\r\\nthen lest he should speak extravagantly any more forever? In view of the future\\r\\nor possible, we should live quite laxly and undefined in front, our outlines\\r\\ndim and misty on that side; as our shadows reveal an insensible perspiration\\r\\ntoward the sun. The volatile truth of our words should continually betray the\\r\\ninadequacy of the residual statement. Their truth is instantly\\r\\ntranslated; its literal monument alone remains. The words which express\\r\\nour faith and piety are not definite; yet they are significant and fragrant\\r\\nlike frankincense to superior natures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhy level downward to our dullest perception always, and praise that as common\\r\\nsense? The commonest sense is the sense of men asleep, which they express by\\r\\nsnoring. Sometimes we are inclined to class those who are\\r\\nonce-and-a-half-witted with the half-witted, because we appreciate only a third\\r\\npart of their wit. Some would find fault with the morning-red, if they ever got\\r\\nup early enough. “They pretend,” as I hear, “that the verses\\r\\nof Kabir have four different senses; illusion, spirit, intellect, and the\\r\\nexoteric doctrine of the Vedas;” but in this part of the world it is\\r\\nconsidered a ground for complaint if a man’s writings admit of more than\\r\\none interpretation. While England endeavors to cure the potato-rot, will not\\r\\nany endeavor to cure the brain-rot, which prevails so much more widely and\\r\\nfatally?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI do not suppose that I have attained to obscurity, but I should be proud if no\\r\\nmore fatal fault were found with my pages on this score than was found with the\\r\\nWalden ice. Southern customers objected to its blue color, which is the\\r\\nevidence of its purity, as if it were muddy, and preferred the Cambridge ice,\\r\\nwhich is white, but tastes of weeds. The purity men love is like the mists\\r\\nwhich envelop the earth, and not like the azure ether beyond.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSome are dinning in our ears that we Americans, and moderns generally, are\\r\\nintellectual dwarfs compared with the ancients, or even the Elizabethan men.\\r\\nBut what is that to the purpose? A living dog is better than a dead lion. Shall\\r\\na man go and hang himself because he belongs to the race of pygmies, and not be\\r\\nthe biggest pygmy that he can? Let every one mind his own business, and\\r\\nendeavor to be what he was made.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhy should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate\\r\\nenterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is\\r\\nbecause he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears,\\r\\nhowever measured or far away. It is not important that he should mature as soon\\r\\nas an apple-tree or an oak. Shall he turn his spring into summer? If the\\r\\ncondition of things which we were made for is not yet, what were any reality\\r\\nwhich we can substitute? We will not be shipwrecked on a vain reality. Shall we\\r\\nwith pains erect a heaven of blue glass over ourselves, though when it is done\\r\\nwe shall be sure to gaze still at the true ethereal heaven far above, as if the\\r\\nformer were not?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive after\\r\\nperfection. One day it came into his mind to make a staff. Having considered\\r\\nthat in an imperfect work time is an ingredient, but into a perfect work time\\r\\ndoes not enter, he said to himself, It shall be perfect in all respects, though\\r\\nI should do nothing else in my life. He proceeded instantly to the forest for\\r\\nwood, being resolved that it should not be made of unsuitable material; and as\\r\\nhe searched for and rejected stick after stick, his friends gradually deserted\\r\\nhim, for they grew old in their works and died, but he grew not older by a\\r\\nmoment. His singleness of purpose and resolution, and his elevated piety,\\r\\nendowed him, without his knowledge, with perennial youth. As he made no\\r\\ncompromise with Time, Time kept out of his way, and only sighed at a distance\\r\\nbecause he could not overcome him. Before he had found a stock in all respects\\r\\nsuitable the city of Kouroo was a hoary ruin, and he sat on one of its mounds\\r\\nto peel the stick. Before he had given it the proper shape the dynasty of the\\r\\nCandahars was at an end, and with the point of the stick he wrote the name of\\r\\nthe last of that race in the sand, and then resumed his work. By the time he\\r\\nhad smoothed and polished the staff Kalpa was no longer the pole-star; and ere\\r\\nhe had put on the ferrule and the head adorned with precious stones, Brahma had\\r\\nawoke and slumbered many times. But why do I stay to mention these things? When\\r\\nthe finishing stroke was put to his work, it suddenly expanded before the eyes\\r\\nof the astonished artist into the fairest of all the creations of Brahma. He\\r\\nhad made a new system in making a staff, a world with full and fair\\r\\nproportions; in which, though the old cities and dynasties had passed away,\\r\\nfairer and more glorious ones had taken their places. And now he saw by the\\r\\nheap of shavings still fresh at his feet, that, for him and his work, the\\r\\nformer lapse of time had been an illusion, and that no more time had elapsed\\r\\nthan is required for a single scintillation from the brain of Brahma to fall on\\r\\nand inflame the tinder of a mortal brain. The material was pure, and his art\\r\\nwas pure; how could the result be other than wonderful?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNo face which we can give to a matter will stead us so well at last as the\\r\\ntruth. This alone wears well. For the most part, we are not where we are, but\\r\\nin a false position. Through an infinity of our natures, we suppose a case, and\\r\\nput ourselves into it, and hence are in two cases at the same time, and it is\\r\\ndoubly difficult to get out. In sane moments we regard only the facts, the case\\r\\nthat is. Say what you have to say, not what you ought. Any truth is better than\\r\\nmake-believe. Tom Hyde, the tinker, standing on the gallows, was asked if he\\r\\nhad anything to say. “Tell the tailors,” said he, “to\\r\\nremember to make a knot in their thread before they take the first\\r\\nstitch.” His companion’s prayer is forgotten.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHowever mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it hard\\r\\nnames. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The\\r\\nfault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life, poor as it is.\\r\\nYou may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a\\r\\npoor-house. The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the alms-house as\\r\\nbrightly as from the rich man’s abode; the snow melts before its door as\\r\\nearly in the spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly\\r\\nthere, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace. The town’s poor\\r\\nseem to me often to live the most independent lives of any. May be they are\\r\\nsimply great enough to receive without misgiving. Most think that they are\\r\\nabove being supported by the town; but it oftener happens that they are not\\r\\nabove supporting themselves by dishonest means, which should be more\\r\\ndisreputable. Cultivate poverty like a garden herb, like sage. Do not trouble\\r\\nyourself much to get new things, whether clothes or friends. Turn the old;\\r\\nreturn to them. Things do not change; we change. Sell your clothes and keep\\r\\nyour thoughts. God will see that you do not want society. If I were confined to\\r\\na corner of a garret all my days, like a spider, the world would be just as\\r\\nlarge to me while I had my thoughts about me. The philosopher said: “From\\r\\nan army of three divisions one can take away its general, and put it in\\r\\ndisorder; from the man the most abject and vulgar one cannot take away his\\r\\nthought.” Do not seek so anxiously to be developed, to subject yourself\\r\\nto many influences to be played on; it is all dissipation. Humility like\\r\\ndarkness reveals the heavenly lights. The shadows of poverty and meanness\\r\\ngather around us, “and lo! creation widens to our view.” We are\\r\\noften reminded that if there were bestowed on us the wealth of CrÅ\\x93sus, our\\r\\naims must still be the same, and our means essentially the same. Moreover, if\\r\\nyou are restricted in your range by poverty, if you cannot buy books and\\r\\nnewspapers, for instance, you are but confined to the most significant and\\r\\nvital experiences; you are compelled to deal with the material which yields the\\r\\nmost sugar and the most starch. It is life near the bone where it is sweetest.\\r\\nYou are defended from being a trifler. No man loses ever on a lower level by\\r\\nmagnanimity on a higher. Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only. Money\\r\\nis not required to buy one necessary of the soul.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI live in the angle of a leaden wall, into whose composition was poured a\\r\\nlittle alloy of bell metal. Often, in the repose of my mid-day, there reaches\\r\\nmy ears a confused tintinnabulum from without. It is the noise of my\\r\\ncontemporaries. My neighbors tell me of their adventures with famous gentlemen\\r\\nand ladies, what notabilities they met at the dinner-table; but I am no more\\r\\ninterested in such things than in the contents of the Daily Times. The interest\\r\\nand the conversation are about costume and manners chiefly; but a goose is a\\r\\ngoose still, dress it as you will. They tell me of California and Texas, of\\r\\nEngland and the Indies, of the Hon. Mr. —— of Georgia or of\\r\\nMassachusetts, all transient and fleeting phenomena, till I am ready to leap\\r\\nfrom their court-yard like the Mameluke bey. I delight to come to my\\r\\nbearings,—not walk in procession with pomp and parade, in a conspicuous\\r\\nplace, but to walk even with the Builder of the universe, if I may,—not\\r\\nto live in this restless, nervous, bustling, trivial Nineteenth Century, but\\r\\nstand or sit thoughtfully while it goes by. What are men celebrating? They are\\r\\nall on a committee of arrangements, and hourly expect a speech from somebody.\\r\\nGod is only the president of the day, and Webster is his orator. I love to\\r\\nweigh, to settle, to gravitate toward that which most strongly and rightfully\\r\\nattracts me;—not hang by the beam of the scale and try to weigh\\r\\nless,—not suppose a case, but take the case that is; to travel the only\\r\\npath I can, and that on which no power can resist me. It affords me no\\r\\nsatisfaction to commence to spring an arch before I have got a solid\\r\\nfoundation. Let us not play at kittly-benders. There is a solid bottom every\\r\\nwhere. We read that the traveller asked the boy if the swamp before him had a\\r\\nhard bottom. The boy replied that it had. But presently the traveller’s\\r\\nhorse sank in up to the girths, and he observed to the boy, “I thought\\r\\nyou said that this bog had a hard bottom.” “So it has,”\\r\\nanswered the latter, “but you have not got half way to it yet.” So\\r\\nit is with the bogs and quicksands of society; but he is an old boy that knows\\r\\nit. Only what is thought, said, or done at a certain rare coincidence is good. I\\r\\nwould not be one of those who will foolishly drive a nail into mere lath and\\r\\nplastering; such a deed would keep me awake nights. Give me a hammer, and let\\r\\nme feel for the furring. Do not depend on the putty. Drive a nail home and\\r\\nclinch it so faithfully that you can wake up in the night and think of your\\r\\nwork with satisfaction,—a work at which you would not be ashamed to\\r\\ninvoke the Muse. So will help you God, and so only. Every nail driven should be\\r\\nas another rivet in the machine of the universe, you carrying on the work.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nRather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth. I sat at a table where\\r\\nwere rich food and wine in abundance, and obsequious attendance, but sincerity\\r\\nand truth were not; and I went away hungry from the inhospitable board. The\\r\\nhospitality was as cold as the ices. I thought that there was no need of ice to\\r\\nfreeze them. They talked to me of the age of the wine and the fame of the\\r\\nvintage; but I thought of an older, a newer, and purer wine, of a more glorious\\r\\nvintage, which they had not got, and could not buy. The style, the house and\\r\\ngrounds and “entertainment” pass for nothing with me. I called on\\r\\nthe king, but he made me wait in his hall, and conducted like a man\\r\\nincapacitated for hospitality. There was a man in my neighborhood who lived in\\r\\na hollow tree. His manners were truly regal. I should have done better had I\\r\\ncalled on him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHow long shall we sit in our porticoes practising idle and musty virtues, which\\r\\nany work would make impertinent? As if one were to begin the day with\\r\\nlong-suffering, and hire a man to hoe his potatoes; and in the afternoon go\\r\\nforth to practise Christian meekness and charity with goodness aforethought!\\r\\nConsider the China pride and stagnant self-complacency of mankind. This\\r\\ngeneration inclines a little to congratulate itself on being the last of an\\r\\nillustrious line; and in Boston and London and Paris and Rome, thinking of its\\r\\nlong descent, it speaks of its progress in art and science and literature with\\r\\nsatisfaction. There are the Records of the Philosophical Societies, and the\\r\\npublic Eulogies of Great Men! It is the good Adam contemplating his own\\r\\nvirtue. “Yes, we have done great deeds, and sung divine songs, which\\r\\nshall never die,”—that is, as long as we can remember them.\\r\\nThe learned societies and great men of Assyria,—where are they? What\\r\\nyouthful philosophers and experimentalists we are! There is not one of my\\r\\nreaders who has yet lived a whole human life. These may be but the spring\\r\\nmonths in the life of the race. If we have had the seven-years’ itch, we\\r\\nhave not seen the seventeen-year locust yet in Concord. We are acquainted with\\r\\na mere pellicle of the globe on which we live. Most have not delved six feet\\r\\nbeneath the surface, nor leaped as many above it. We know not where we are.\\r\\nBeside, we are sound asleep nearly half our time. Yet we esteem ourselves wise,\\r\\nand have an established order on the surface. Truly, we are deep thinkers, we\\r\\nare ambitious spirits! As I stand over the insect crawling amid the pine\\r\\nneedles on the forest floor, and endeavoring to conceal itself from my sight,\\r\\nand ask myself why it will cherish those humble thoughts, and hide its head\\r\\nfrom me who might, perhaps, be its benefactor, and impart to its race some\\r\\ncheering information, I am reminded of the greater Benefactor and Intelligence\\r\\nthat stands over me the human insect.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere is an incessant influx of novelty into the world, and yet we tolerate\\r\\nincredible dulness. I need only suggest what kind of sermons are still listened\\r\\nto in the most enlightened countries. There are such words as joy and sorrow,\\r\\nbut they are only the burden of a psalm, sung with a nasal twang, while we\\r\\nbelieve in the ordinary and mean. We think that we can change our clothes only.\\r\\nIt is said that the British Empire is very large and respectable, and that the\\r\\nUnited States are a first-rate power. We do not believe that a tide rises and\\r\\nfalls behind every man which can float the British Empire like a chip, if he\\r\\nshould ever harbor it in his mind. Who knows what sort of seventeen-year locust\\r\\nwill next come out of the ground? The government of the world I live in was not\\r\\nframed, like that of Britain, in after-dinner conversations over the wine.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe life in us is like the water in the river. It may rise this year higher\\r\\nthan man has ever known it, and flood the parched uplands; even this may be the\\r\\neventful year, which will drown out all our muskrats. It was not always dry\\r\\nland where we dwell. I see far inland the banks which the stream anciently\\r\\nwashed, before science began to record its freshets. Every one has heard the\\r\\nstory which has gone the rounds of New England, of a strong and beautiful bug\\r\\nwhich came out of the dry leaf of an old table of apple-tree wood, which had\\r\\nstood in a farmer’s kitchen for sixty years, first in Connecticut, and\\r\\nafterward in Massachusetts,—from an egg deposited in the living tree many\\r\\nyears earlier still, as appeared by counting the annual layers beyond it; which\\r\\nwas heard gnawing out for several weeks, hatched perchance by the heat of an\\r\\nurn. Who does not feel his faith in a resurrection and immortality strengthened\\r\\nby hearing of this? Who knows what beautiful and winged life, whose egg has\\r\\nbeen buried for ages under many concentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry\\r\\nlife of society, deposited at first in the alburnum of the green and living\\r\\ntree, which has been gradually converted into the semblance of its\\r\\nwell-seasoned tomb,—heard perchance gnawing out now for years by the\\r\\nastonished family of man, as they sat round the festive board,—may\\r\\nunexpectedly come forth from amidst society’s most trivial and handselled\\r\\nfurniture, to enjoy its perfect summer life at last!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI do not say that John or Jonathan will realize all this; but such is the\\r\\ncharacter of that morrow which mere lapse of time can never make to dawn. The\\r\\nlight which puts out our eyes is darkness to us. Only that day dawns to which\\r\\nwe are awake. There is more day to dawn. The sun is but a morning star.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n\\n ON THE DUTY OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE\\n\\r\\nI heartily accept the motto,—“That government is best which governs\\r\\nleast;” and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and\\r\\nsystematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I\\r\\nbelieve—“That government is best which governs not at\\r\\nall;” and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of\\r\\ngovernment which they will have. Government is at best but an expedient;\\r\\nbut most governments are usually, and all governments are sometimes,\\r\\ninexpedient. The objections which have been brought against a standing\\r\\narmy, and they are many and weighty, and deserve to prevail, may also at\\r\\nlast be brought against a standing government. The standing army is only\\r\\nan arm of the standing government. The government itself, which is only\\r\\nthe mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally\\r\\nliable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.\\r\\nWitness the present Mexican war, the work of comparatively a few\\r\\nindividuals using the standing government as their tool; for, in the\\r\\noutset, the people would not have consented to this measure.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis American government,—what is it but a tradition, though a\\r\\nrecent one, endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity, but\\r\\neach instant losing some of its integrity? It has not the vitality and\\r\\nforce of a single living man; for a single man can bend it to his will. It\\r\\nis a sort of wooden gun to the people themselves; and, if ever they should\\r\\nuse it in earnest as a real one against each other, it will surely split.\\r\\nBut it is not the less necessary for this; for the people must have some\\r\\ncomplicated machinery or other, and hear its din, to satisfy that idea of\\r\\ngovernment which they have. Governments show thus how successfully men can\\r\\nbe imposed on, even impose on themselves, for their own advantage. It is\\r\\nexcellent, we must all allow; yet this government never of itself\\r\\nfurthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of its\\r\\nway. It does not keep the country free. It does not settle\\r\\nthe West. It does not educate. The character inherent in the\\r\\nAmerican people has done all that has been accomplished; and it would have\\r\\ndone somewhat more, if the government had not sometimes got in its way.\\r\\nFor government is an expedient, by which men would fain succeed in letting\\r\\none another alone; and, as has been said, when it is most expedient, the\\r\\ngoverned are most let alone by it. Trade and commerce, if they were not\\r\\nmade of India rubber, would never manage to bounce over obstacles which\\r\\nlegislators are continually putting in their way; and, if one were to judge\\r\\nthese men wholly by the effects of their actions, and not partly by their\\r\\nintentions, they would deserve to be classed and punished with those\\r\\nmischievous persons who put obstructions on the railroads.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut, to speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who call\\r\\nthemselves no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government, but\\r\\nat once a better government. Let every man make known what kind of\\r\\ngovernment would command his respect, and that will be one step toward\\r\\nobtaining it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in the hands\\r\\nof the people, a majority are permitted, and for a long period continue,\\r\\nto rule, is not because they are most likely to be in the right, nor\\r\\nbecause this seems fairest to the minority, but because they are\\r\\nphysically the strongest. But a government in which the majority rule in\\r\\nall cases can not be based on justice, even as far as men understand it.\\r\\nCan there not be a government in which the majorities do not virtually\\r\\ndecide right and wrong, but conscience?—in which majorities decide\\r\\nonly those questions to which the rule of expediency is applicable? Must\\r\\nthe citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his\\r\\nconscience to the legislator? Why has every man a conscience, then? I think\\r\\nthat we should be men first, and subjects afterward. It is not desirable\\r\\nto cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only\\r\\nobligation which I have a right to assume, is to do at any time what I\\r\\nthink right. It is truly enough said that a corporation has no conscience;\\r\\nbut a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation with a\\r\\nconscience. Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their\\r\\nrespect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of\\r\\ninjustice. A common and natural result of an undue respect for the law is,\\r\\nthat you may see a file of soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal, privates,\\r\\npowder-monkeys and all, marching in admirable order over hill and dale to\\r\\nthe wars, against their wills, aye, against their common sense and\\r\\nconsciences, which makes it very steep marching indeed, and produces a\\r\\npalpitation of the heart. They have no doubt that it is a damnable\\r\\nbusiness in which they are concerned; they are all peaceably inclined.\\r\\nNow, what are they? Men at all? or small movable forts and magazines, at\\r\\nthe service of some unscrupulous man in power? Visit the Navy Yard, and\\r\\nbehold a marine, such a man as an American government can make, or such as\\r\\nit can make a man with its black arts, a mere shadow and reminiscence\\r\\nof humanity, a man laid out alive and standing, and already, as one may\\r\\nsay, buried under arms with funeral accompaniment, though it may be\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0As his corpse to the ramparts we hurried;\\r\\nNot a soldier discharged his farewell shot\\r\\nÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0O’er the grave where our hero we buried.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe mass of men serve the State thus, not as men mainly, but as machines,\\r\\nwith their bodies. They are the standing army, and the militia, jailers,\\r\\nconstables, posse comitatus, &c. In most cases there is no free\\r\\nexercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense; but they put\\r\\nthemselves on a level with wood and earth and stones; and wooden men can\\r\\nperhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well. Such command\\r\\nno more respect than men of straw, or a lump of dirt. They have the same\\r\\nsort of worth only as horses and dogs. Yet such as these even are commonly\\r\\nesteemed good citizens. Others, as most legislators, politicians, lawyers,\\r\\nministers, and office-holders, serve the state chiefly with their heads;\\r\\nand, as they rarely make any moral distinctions, they are as likely to\\r\\nserve the devil, without intending it, as God. A very few, as\\r\\nheroes, patriots, martyrs, reformers in the great sense, and men,\\r\\nserve the State with their consciences also, and so necessarily resist it\\r\\nfor the most part; and they are commonly treated by it as enemies. A wise\\r\\nman will only be useful as a man, and will not submit to be\\r\\n“clay,” and “stop a hole to keep the wind away,”\\r\\nbut leave that office to his dust at least:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am too high-born to be propertied,\\r\\nTo be a secondary at control,\\r\\nOr useful serving-man and instrument\\r\\nTo any sovereign state throughout the world.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe who gives himself entirely to his fellow-men appears to them useless\\r\\nand selfish; but he who gives himself partially to them is pronounced a\\r\\nbenefactor and philanthropist.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHow does it become a man to behave toward the American government today? I\\r\\nanswer that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it. I cannot\\r\\nfor an instant recognize that political organization as my\\r\\ngovernment which is the slave’s government also.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAll men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right to refuse\\r\\nallegiance to and to resist the government, when its tyranny or its\\r\\ninefficiency are great and unendurable. But almost all say that such is\\r\\nnot the case now. But such was the case, they think, in the Revolution of\\r\\n’75. If one were to tell me that this was a bad government because\\r\\nit taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its ports, it is most\\r\\nprobable that I should not make an ado about it, for I can do without\\r\\nthem: all machines have their friction; and possibly this does enough good\\r\\nto counter-balance the evil. At any rate, it is a great evil to make a\\r\\nstir about it. But when the friction comes to have its machine, and\\r\\noppression and robbery are organized, I say, let us not have such a\\r\\nmachine any longer. In other words, when a sixth of the population of a\\r\\nnation which has undertaken to be the refuge of liberty are slaves, and a\\r\\nwhole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army, and\\r\\nsubjected to military law, I think that it is not too soon for honest men\\r\\nto rebel and revolutionize. What makes this duty the more urgent is that\\r\\nfact, that the country so overrun is not our own, but ours is the invading\\r\\narmy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPaley, a common authority with many on moral questions, in his chapter on\\r\\nthe “Duty of Submission to Civil Government,” resolves all\\r\\ncivil obligation into expediency; and he proceeds to say, “that so\\r\\nlong as the interest of the whole society requires it, that is, so long as\\r\\nthe established government cannot be resisted or changed without public\\r\\ninconveniency, it is the will of God that the established government be\\r\\nobeyed, and no longer.”—“This principle being admitted,\\r\\nthe justice of every particular case of resistance is reduced to a\\r\\ncomputation of the quantity of the danger and grievance on the one side,\\r\\nand of the probability and expense of redressing it on the other.”\\r\\nOf this, he says, every man shall judge for himself. But Paley appears\\r\\nnever to have contemplated those cases to which the rule of expediency\\r\\ndoes not apply, in which a people, as well as an individual, must do\\r\\njustice, cost what it may. If I have unjustly wrested a plank from a\\r\\ndrowning man, I must restore it to him though I drown myself. This,\\r\\naccording to Paley, would be inconvenient. But he that would save his\\r\\nlife, in such a case, shall lose it. This people must cease to hold\\r\\nslaves, and to make war on Mexico, though it cost them their existence as\\r\\na people.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn their practice, nations agree with Paley; but does anyone think that\\r\\nMassachusetts does exactly what is right at the present crisis?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A drab of state, a cloth-o’-silver slut,\\r\\nTo have her train borne up, and her soul trail in the dirt.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPractically speaking, the opponents to a reform in Massachusetts are not a\\r\\nhundred thousand politicians at the South, but a hundred thousand\\r\\nmerchants and farmers here, who are more interested in commerce and\\r\\nagriculture than they are in humanity, and are not prepared to do justice\\r\\nto the slave and to Mexico, cost what it may. I quarrel not with\\r\\nfar-off foes, but with those who, near at home, co-operate with, and do\\r\\nthe bidding of those far away, and without whom the latter would be\\r\\nharmless. We are accustomed to say, that the mass of men are unprepared;\\r\\nbut improvement is slow, because the few are not materially wiser or\\r\\nbetter than the many. It is not so important that many should be as good\\r\\nas you, as that there be some absolute goodness somewhere; for that will\\r\\nleaven the whole lump. There are thousands who are in opinion\\r\\nopposed to slavery and to the war, who yet in effect do nothing to put an\\r\\nend to them; who, esteeming themselves children of Washington and\\r\\nFranklin, sit down with their hands in their pockets, and say that they\\r\\nknow not what to do, and do nothing; who even postpone the question of\\r\\nfreedom to the question of free-trade, and quietly read the prices-current\\r\\nalong with the latest advices from Mexico, after dinner, and, it may be,\\r\\nfall asleep over them both. What is the price-current of an honest man and\\r\\npatriot today? They hesitate, and they regret, and sometimes they\\r\\npetition; but they do nothing in earnest and with effect. They will wait,\\r\\nwell disposed, for others to remedy the evil, that they may no longer have\\r\\nit to regret. At most, they give only a cheap vote, and a feeble\\r\\ncountenance and Godspeed, to the right, as it goes by them. There are nine\\r\\nhundred and ninety-nine patrons of virtue to one virtuous man; but it is\\r\\neasier to deal with the real possessor of a thing than with the temporary\\r\\nguardian of it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAll voting is a sort of gaming, like chequers or backgammon, with a slight\\r\\nmoral tinge to it, a playing with right and wrong, with moral questions;\\r\\nand betting naturally accompanies it. The character of the voters is not\\r\\nstaked. I cast my vote, perchance, as I think right; but I am not vitally\\r\\nconcerned that that right should prevail. I am willing to leave it to the\\r\\nmajority. Its obligation, therefore, never exceeds that of expediency.\\r\\nEven voting for the right is doing nothing for it. It is\\r\\nonly expressing to men feebly your desire that it should prevail. A wise\\r\\nman will not leave the right to the mercy of chance, nor wish it to\\r\\nprevail through the power of the majority. There is but little virtue in\\r\\nthe action of masses of men. When the majority shall at length vote for\\r\\nthe abolition of slavery, it will be because they are indifferent to\\r\\nslavery, or because there is but little slavery left to be abolished by\\r\\ntheir vote. They will then be the only slaves. Only his vote\\r\\ncan hasten the abolition of slavery who asserts his own freedom by his\\r\\nvote.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI hear of a convention to be held at Baltimore, or elsewhere, for the\\r\\nselection of a candidate for the Presidency, made up chiefly of editors,\\r\\nand men who are politicians by profession; but I think, what is it to any\\r\\nindependent, intelligent, and respectable man what decision they may come\\r\\nto, shall we not have the advantage of his wisdom and honesty,\\r\\nnevertheless? Can we not count upon some independent votes? Are there not\\r\\nmany individuals in the country who do not attend conventions? But no: I\\r\\nfind that the respectable man, so called, has immediately drifted from his\\r\\nposition, and despairs of his country, when his country has more reasons\\r\\nto despair of him. He forthwith adopts one of the candidates thus selected\\r\\nas the only available one, thus proving that he is himself\\r\\navailable for any purposes of the demagogue. His vote is of no more\\r\\nworth than that of any unprincipled foreigner or hireling native, who may\\r\\nhave been bought. Oh for a man who is a man, and, as my neighbor\\r\\nsays, has a bone in his back which you cannot pass your hand through! Our\\r\\nstatistics are at fault: the population has been returned too large. How\\r\\nmany men are there to a square thousand miles in the country?\\r\\nHardly one. Does not America offer any inducement for men to settle here?\\r\\nThe American has dwindled into an Odd Fellow,—one who may be known\\r\\nby the development of his organ of gregariousness, and a manifest lack of\\r\\nintellect and cheerful self-reliance; whose first and chief concern, on\\r\\ncoming into the world, is to see that the alms-houses are in good repair;\\r\\nand, before yet he has lawfully donned the virile garb, to collect a fund\\r\\nfor the support of the widows and orphans that may be; who, in short,\\r\\nventures to live only by the aid of the Mutual Insurance company, which\\r\\nhas promised to bury him decently.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is not a man’s duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to\\r\\nthe eradication of any, even the most enormous wrong; he may still\\r\\nproperly have other concerns to engage him; but it is his duty, at least,\\r\\nto wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer, not to\\r\\ngive it practically his support. If I devote myself to other pursuits and\\r\\ncontemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them\\r\\nsitting upon another man’s shoulders. I must get off him first, that\\r\\nhe may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency is\\r\\ntolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, “I should like to\\r\\nhave them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves, or\\r\\nto march to Mexico,—see if I would go;” and yet these very men\\r\\nhave each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by\\r\\ntheir money, furnished a substitute. The soldier is applauded who refuses\\r\\nto serve in an unjust war by those who do not refuse to sustain the unjust\\r\\ngovernment which makes the war; is applauded by those whose own act and\\r\\nauthority he disregards and sets at naught; as if the State were penitent\\r\\nto that degree that it hired one to scourge it while it sinned, but not to\\r\\nthat degree that it left off sinning for a moment. Thus, under the name of\\r\\nOrder and Civil Government, we are all made at last to pay homage to and\\r\\nsupport our own meanness. After the first blush of sin, comes its\\r\\nindifference; and from immoral it becomes, as it were, unmoral, and\\r\\nnot quite unnecessary to that life which we have made.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe broadest and most prevalent error requires the most disinterested\\r\\nvirtue to sustain it. The slight reproach to which the virtue of\\r\\npatriotism is commonly liable, the noble are most likely to incur. Those\\r\\nwho, while they disapprove of the character and measures of a government,\\r\\nyield to it their allegiance and support, are undoubtedly its most\\r\\nconscientious supporters, and so frequently the most serious obstacles to\\r\\nreform. Some are petitioning the State to dissolve the Union, to disregard\\r\\nthe requisitions of the President. Why do they not dissolve it\\r\\nthemselves,—the union between themselves and the State,—and\\r\\nrefuse to pay their quota into its treasury? Do not they stand in same\\r\\nrelation to the State, that the State does to the Union? And have not the\\r\\nsame reasons prevented the State from resisting the Union, which have\\r\\nprevented them from resisting the State?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHow can a man be satisfied to entertain an opinion merely, and enjoy\\r\\nit? Is there any enjoyment in it, if his opinion is that he is\\r\\naggrieved? If you are cheated out of a single dollar by your neighbor, you\\r\\ndo not rest satisfied with knowing you are cheated, or with saying that\\r\\nyou are cheated, or even with petitioning him to pay you your due; but you\\r\\ntake effectual steps at once to obtain the full amount, and see that you\\r\\nare never cheated again. Action from principle,—the perception and\\r\\nthe performance of right,—changes things and relations; it is\\r\\nessentially revolutionary, and does not consist wholly with anything which\\r\\nwas. It not only divided states and churches, it divides families; aye, it\\r\\ndivides the individual, separating the diabolical in him from the\\r\\ndivine.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUnjust laws exist: shall we be content to obey them, or shall we endeavor\\r\\nto amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall we\\r\\ntransgress them at once? Men generally, under such a government as this,\\r\\nthink that they ought to wait until they have persuaded the majority to\\r\\nalter them. They think that, if they should resist, the remedy would be\\r\\nworse than the evil. But it is the fault of the government itself that the\\r\\nremedy is worse than the evil. It makes it worse. Why is it\\r\\nnot more apt to anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not cherish\\r\\nits wise minority? Why does it cry and resist before it is hurt? Why does\\r\\nit not encourage its citizens to be on the alert to point out its faults,\\r\\nand do better than it would have them? Why does it always crucify\\r\\nChrist, and excommunicate Copernicus and Luther, and pronounce Washington\\r\\nand Franklin rebels?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne would think, that a deliberate and practical denial of its authority\\r\\nwas the only offence never contemplated by government; else, why has\\r\\nit not assigned its definite, its suitable and proportionate penalty? If\\r\\na man who has no property refuses but once to earn nine shillings for the\\r\\nState, he is put in prison for a period unlimited by any law that I know,\\r\\nand determined only by the discretion of those who placed him there; but if\\r\\nhe should steal ninety times nine shillings from the State, he is soon\\r\\npermitted to go at large again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIf the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of\\r\\ngovernment, let it go, let it go: perchance it will wear\\r\\nsmooth,—certainly the machine will wear out. If the injustice has a\\r\\nspring, or a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself, then\\r\\nperhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than the\\r\\nevil; but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent\\r\\nof injustice to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be a\\r\\ncounter friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to see, at any\\r\\nrate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs for adopting the ways which the State has provided for remedying the\\r\\nevil, I know not of such ways. They take too much time, and a man’s\\r\\nlife will be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into this\\r\\nworld, not chiefly to make this a good place to live in, but to live in\\r\\nit, be it good or bad. A man has not every thing to do, but something; and\\r\\nbecause he cannot do every thing, it is not necessary that he should\\r\\ndo something wrong. It is not my business to be petitioning\\r\\nthe Governor or the Legislature any more than it is theirs to petition me;\\r\\nand, if they should not hear my petition, what should I do then? But in\\r\\nthis case the State has provided no way: its very Constitution is the\\r\\nevil. This may seem to be harsh and stubborn and unconcilliatory; but it\\r\\nis to treat with the utmost kindness and consideration the only spirit\\r\\nthat can appreciate or deserves it. So is all change for the better, like\\r\\nbirth and death which convulse the body.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI do not hesitate to say, that those who call themselves abolitionists\\r\\nshould at once effectually withdraw their support, both in person and\\r\\nproperty, from the government of Massachusetts, and not wait till they\\r\\nconstitute a majority of one, before they suffer the right to prevail\\r\\nthrough them. I think that it is enough if they have God on their side,\\r\\nwithout waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more right than his\\r\\nneighbors constitutes a majority of one already.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI meet this American government, or its representative, the State\\r\\ngovernment, directly, and face to face, once a year, no more, in\\r\\nthe person of its tax-gatherer; this is the only mode in which a man\\r\\nsituated as I am necessarily meets it; and it then says distinctly,\\r\\nRecognize me; and the simplest, the most effectual, and, in the present\\r\\nposture of affairs, the indispensablest mode of treating with it on this\\r\\nhead, of expressing your little satisfaction with and love for it, is to\\r\\ndeny it then. My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have\\r\\nto deal with,—for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment\\r\\nthat I quarrel,—and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the\\r\\ngovernment. How shall he ever know well what he is and does as an officer\\r\\nof the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he\\r\\nshall treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and\\r\\nwell-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if\\r\\nhe can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and\\r\\nmore impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action? I know\\r\\nthis well, that if one thousand, if one hundred, if ten men whom I could\\r\\nname,—if ten honest men only,—aye, if one HONEST\\r\\nman, in this State of Massachusetts, ceasing to hold slaves, were\\r\\nactually to withdraw from this copartnership, and be locked up in the\\r\\ncounty jail therefor, it would be the abolition of slavery in America. For\\r\\nit matters not how small the beginning may seem to be: what is once well\\r\\ndone is done for ever. But we love better to talk about it: that we say is\\r\\nour mission. Reform keeps many scores of newspapers in its service, but\\r\\nnot one man. If my esteemed neighbor, the State’s ambassador, who\\r\\nwill devote his days to the settlement of the question of human rights in\\r\\nthe Council Chamber, instead of being threatened with the prisons of\\r\\nCarolina, were to sit down the prisoner of Massachusetts, that State which\\r\\nis so anxious to foist the sin of slavery upon her sister,—though at\\r\\npresent she can discover only an act of inhospitality to be the ground of\\r\\na quarrel with her,—the Legislature would not wholly waive the\\r\\nsubject of the following winter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUnder a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man\\r\\nis also a prison. The proper place today, the only place which\\r\\nMassachusetts has provided for her freer and less desponding spirits, is\\r\\nin her prisons, to be put out and locked out of the State by her own act,\\r\\nas they have already put themselves out by their principles. It is there\\r\\nthat the fugitive slave, and the Mexican prisoner on parole, and the\\r\\nIndian come to plead the wrongs of his race, should find them; on that\\r\\nseparate, but more free and honorable ground, where the State places those\\r\\nwho are not with her but against her,—the only house\\r\\nin a slave-state in which a free man can abide with honor. If any think\\r\\nthat their influence would be lost there, and their voices no longer\\r\\nafflict the ear of the State, that they would not be as an enemy within\\r\\nits walls, they do not know by how much truth is stronger than error, nor\\r\\nhow much more eloquently and effectively he can combat injustice who has\\r\\nexperienced a little in his own person. Cast your whole vote, not a strip\\r\\nof paper merely, but your whole influence. A minority is powerless while\\r\\nit conforms to the majority; it is not even a minority then; but it is\\r\\nirresistible when it clogs by its whole weight. If the alternative is to\\r\\nkeep all just men in prison, or give up war and slavery, the State will\\r\\nnot hesitate which to choose. If a thousand men were not to pay their\\r\\ntax-bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it\\r\\nwould be to pay them, and enable the State to commit violence and shed\\r\\ninnocent blood. This is, in fact, the definition of a peaceable\\r\\nrevolution, if any such is possible. If the tax-gatherer, or any other\\r\\npublic officer, asks me, as one has done, “But what shall I\\r\\ndo?” my answer is, “If you really wish to do any thing, resign\\r\\nyour office.” When the subject has refused allegiance, and the\\r\\nofficer has resigned his office, then the revolution is accomplished. But\\r\\neven suppose blood should flow. Is there not a sort of blood shed when the\\r\\nconscience is wounded? Through this wound a man’s real manhood and\\r\\nimmortality flow out, and he bleeds to an everlasting death. I see this\\r\\nblood flowing now.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have contemplated the imprisonment of the offender, rather than the\\r\\nseizure of his goods,—though both will serve the same\\r\\npurpose,—because they who assert the purest right, and consequently\\r\\nare most dangerous to a corrupt State, commonly have not spent much time\\r\\nin accumulating property. To such the State renders comparatively small\\r\\nservice, and a slight tax is wont to appear exorbitant, particularly if\\r\\nthey are obliged to earn it by special labor with their hands. If there\\r\\nwere one who lived wholly without the use of money, the State itself would\\r\\nhesitate to demand it of him. But the rich man—not to make any\\r\\ninvidious comparison—is always sold to the institution which makes\\r\\nhim rich. Absolutely speaking, the more money, the less virtue; for money\\r\\ncomes between a man and his objects, and obtains them for him; it was\\r\\ncertainly no great virtue to obtain it. It puts to rest many questions\\r\\nwhich he would otherwise be taxed to answer; while the only new question\\r\\nwhich it puts is the hard but superfluous one, how to spend it. Thus his\\r\\nmoral ground is taken from under his feet. The opportunities of living are\\r\\ndiminished in proportion as what are called the “means” are\\r\\nincreased. The best thing a man can do for his culture when he is rich is\\r\\nto endeavor to carry out those schemes which he entertained when he was\\r\\npoor. Christ answered the Herodians according to their condition.\\r\\n“Show me the tribute-money,” said he;—and one took a\\r\\npenny out of his pocket;—if you use money which has the image of\\r\\nCÃ¦sar on it, and which he has made current and valuable, that is, if\\r\\nyou are men of the State, and gladly enjoy the advantages of\\r\\nCÃ¦sar’s government, then pay him back some of his own when he\\r\\ndemands it; “Render therefore to CÃ¦sar that which is CÃ¦sar’s\\r\\nand to God those things which are God’s,”—leaving them no\\r\\nwiser than before as to which was which; for they did not wish to know.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I converse with the freest of my neighbors, I perceive that, whatever\\r\\nthey may say about the magnitude and seriousness of the question, and\\r\\ntheir regard for the public tranquillity, the long and the short of the\\r\\nmatter is, that they cannot spare the protection of the existing\\r\\ngovernment, and they dread the consequences of disobedience to it to their\\r\\nproperty and families. For my own part, I should not like to think that I\\r\\never rely on the protection of the State. But, if I deny the authority of\\r\\nthe State when it presents its tax-bill, it will soon take and waste all\\r\\nmy property, and so harass me and my children without end. This is hard.\\r\\nThis makes it impossible for a man to live honestly and at the same time\\r\\ncomfortably in outward respects. It will not be worth the while to\\r\\naccumulate property; that would be sure to go again. You must hire or\\r\\nsquat somewhere, and raise but a small crop, and eat that soon. You must\\r\\nlive within yourself, and depend upon yourself, always tucked up and ready\\r\\nfor a start, and not have many affairs. A man may grow rich in Turkey\\r\\neven, if he will be in all respects a good subject of the Turkish\\r\\ngovernment. Confucius said,—“If a State is governed by the\\r\\nprinciples of reason, poverty and misery are subjects of shame; if a State\\r\\nis not governed by the principles of reason, riches and honors are the\\r\\nsubjects of shame.” No: until I want the protection of Massachusetts\\r\\nto be extended to me in some distant southern port, where my liberty is\\r\\nendangered, or until I am bent solely on building up an estate at home by\\r\\npeaceful enterprise, I can afford to refuse allegiance to Massachusetts,\\r\\nand her right to my property and life. It costs me less in every sense to\\r\\nincur the penalty of disobedience to the State, than it would to obey. I\\r\\nshould feel as if I were worth less in that case.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSome years ago, the State met me in behalf of the church, and commanded me\\r\\nto pay a certain sum toward the support of a clergyman whose preaching my\\r\\nfather attended, but never I myself. “Pay it,” it said, “or\\r\\nbe locked up in the jail.” I declined to pay. But, unfortunately,\\r\\nanother man saw fit to pay it. I did not see why the schoolmaster should\\r\\nbe taxed to support the priest, and not the priest the schoolmaster; for I\\r\\nwas not the State’s schoolmaster, but I supported myself by\\r\\nvoluntary subscription. I did not see why the lyceum should not present\\r\\nits tax-bill, and have the State to back its demand, as well as the\\r\\nchurch. However, at the request of the selectmen, I condescended to make\\r\\nsome such statement as this in writing:—“Know all men by these\\r\\npresents, that I, Henry Thoreau, do not wish to be regarded as a member of\\r\\nany incorporated society which I have not joined.” This I gave to\\r\\nthe town-clerk; and he has it. The State, having thus learned that I did\\r\\nnot wish to be regarded as a member of that church, has never made a like\\r\\ndemand on me since; though it said that it must adhere to its original\\r\\npresumption that time. If I had known how to name them, I should then have\\r\\nsigned off in detail from all the societies which I never signed on to;\\r\\nbut I did not know where to find such a complete list.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have paid no poll-tax for six years. I was put into a jail once on this\\r\\naccount, for one night; and, as I stood considering the walls of solid\\r\\nstone, two or three feet thick, the door of wood and iron, a foot thick,\\r\\nand the iron grating which strained the light, I could not help being\\r\\nstruck with the foolishness of that institution which treated me as if I\\r\\nwere mere flesh and blood and bones, to be locked up. I wondered that it\\r\\nshould have concluded at length that this was the best use it could put me\\r\\nto, and had never thought to avail itself of my services in some way. I\\r\\nsaw that, if there was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen, there\\r\\nwas a still more difficult one to climb or break through, before they could\\r\\nget to be as free as I was. I did nor for a moment feel confined, and the\\r\\nwalls seemed a great waste of stone and mortar. I felt as if I alone of\\r\\nall my townsmen had paid my tax. They plainly did not know how to treat\\r\\nme, but behaved like persons who are underbred. In every threat and in\\r\\nevery compliment there was a blunder; for they thought that my chief\\r\\ndesire was to stand the other side of that stone wall. I could not but\\r\\nsmile to see how industriously they locked the door on my meditations,\\r\\nwhich followed them out again without let or hindrance, and they\\r\\nwere really all that was dangerous. As they could not reach me, they had\\r\\nresolved to punish my body; just as boys, if they cannot come at some\\r\\nperson against whom they have a spite, will abuse his dog. I saw that the\\r\\nState was half-witted, that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver\\r\\nspoons, and that it did not know its friends from its foes, and I lost all\\r\\nmy remaining respect for it, and pitied it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus the state never intentionally confronts a man’s sense,\\r\\nintellectual or moral, but only his body, his senses. It is not armed with\\r\\nsuperior wit or honesty, but with superior physical strength. I was not\\r\\nborn to be forced. I will breathe after my own fashion. Let us see who is\\r\\nthe strongest. What force has a multitude? They only can force me who obey\\r\\na higher law than I. They force me to become like themselves. I do not\\r\\nhear of men being forced to live this way or that by masses\\r\\nof men. What sort of life were that to live? When I meet a government\\r\\nwhich says to me, “Your money or your life,” why should I be\\r\\nin haste to give it my money? It may be in a great strait, and not know\\r\\nwhat to do: I cannot help that. It must help itself; do as I do. It is not\\r\\nworth the while to snivel about it. I am not responsible for the\\r\\nsuccessful working of the machinery of society. I am not the son of the\\r\\nengineer. I perceive that, when an acorn and a chestnut fall side by side,\\r\\nthe one does not remain inert to make way for the other, but both obey\\r\\ntheir own laws, and spring and grow and flourish as best they can, till\\r\\none, perchance, overshadows and destroys the other. If a plant cannot live\\r\\naccording to its nature, it dies; and so a man.\\n\\n\\r\\nThe night in prison was novel and interesting enough. The prisoners in\\r\\ntheir shirt-sleeves were enjoying a chat and the evening air in the\\r\\ndoor-way, when I entered. But the jailer said, “Come, boys, it is\\r\\ntime to lock up;” and so they dispersed, and I heard the sound of\\r\\ntheir steps returning into the hollow apartments. My room-mate was\\r\\nintroduced to me by the jailer as “a first-rate fellow and a clever\\r\\nman.” When the door was locked, he showed me where to hang my hat,\\r\\nand how he managed matters there. The rooms were whitewashed once a month;\\r\\nand this one, at least, was the whitest, most simply furnished, and\\r\\nprobably the neatest apartment in town. He naturally wanted to know where I\\r\\ncame from, and what brought me there; and, when I had told him, I asked\\r\\nhim in my turn how he came there, presuming him to be an honest man, of\\r\\ncourse; and, as the world goes, I believe he was. “Why,” said\\r\\nhe, “they accuse me of burning a barn; but I never did it.” As\\r\\nnear as I could discover, he had probably gone to bed in a barn when\\r\\ndrunk, and smoked his pipe there; and so a barn was burnt. He had the\\r\\nreputation of being a clever man, had been there some three months waiting\\r\\nfor his trial to come on, and would have to wait as much longer; but he\\r\\nwas quite domesticated and contented, since he got his board for nothing,\\r\\nand thought that he was well treated.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe occupied one window, and I the other; and I saw, that, if one stayed\\r\\nthere long, his principal business would be to look out the window. I had\\r\\nsoon read all the tracts that were left there, and examined where former\\r\\nprisoners had broken out, and where a grate had been sawed off, and heard\\r\\nthe history of the various occupants of that room; for I found that even\\r\\nhere there was a history and a gossip which never circulated beyond the\\r\\nwalls of the jail. Probably this is the only house in the town where\\r\\nverses are composed, which are afterward printed in a circular form, but\\r\\nnot published. I was shown quite a long list of verses which were composed\\r\\nby some young men who had been detected in an attempt to escape, who\\r\\navenged themselves by singing them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI pumped my fellow-prisoner as dry as I could, for fear I should never see\\r\\nhim again; but at length he showed me which was my bed, and left me to\\r\\nblow out the lamp.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was like travelling into a far country, such as I had never expected to\\r\\nbehold, to lie there for one night. It seemed to me that I never had heard\\r\\nthe town-clock strike before, nor the evening sounds of the village; for\\r\\nwe slept with the windows open, which were inside the grating. It was to\\r\\nsee my native village in the light of the Middle Ages, and our Concord was\\r\\nturned into a Rhine stream, and visions of knights and castles passed\\r\\nbefore me. They were the voices of old burghers that I heard in the\\r\\nstreets. I was an involuntary spectator and auditor of whatever was done\\r\\nand said in the kitchen of the adjacent village-inn—a wholly new and\\r\\nrare experience to me. It was a closer view of my native town. I was\\r\\nfairly inside of it. I never had seen its institutions before. This is one\\r\\nof its peculiar institutions; for it is a shire town. I began to\\r\\ncomprehend what its inhabitants were about.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the morning, our breakfasts were put through the hole in the door, in\\r\\nsmall oblong-square tin pans, made to fit, and holding a pint of\\r\\nchocolate, with brown bread, and an iron spoon. When they called for the\\r\\nvessels again, I was green enough to return what bread I had left; but my\\r\\ncomrade seized it, and said that I should lay that up for lunch or dinner.\\r\\nSoon after, he was let out to work at haying in a neighboring field,\\r\\nwhither he went every day, and would not be back till noon; so he bade me\\r\\ngood-day, saying that he doubted if he should see me again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen I came out of prison,—for some one interfered, and paid the\\r\\ntax,—I did not perceive that great changes had taken place on the\\r\\ncommon, such as he observed who went in a youth, and emerged a gray-headed\\r\\nman; and yet a change had to my eyes come over the scene,—the\\r\\ntown, and State, and country,—greater than any that mere time could\\r\\neffect. I saw yet more distinctly the State in which I lived. I saw to\\r\\nwhat extent the people among whom I lived could be trusted as good\\r\\nneighbors and friends; that their friendship was for summer weather only;\\r\\nthat they did not greatly purpose to do right; that they were a distinct\\r\\nrace from me by their prejudices and superstitions, as the Chinamen and\\r\\nMalays are; that, in their sacrifices to humanity they ran no risks, not\\r\\neven to their property; that, after all, they were not so noble but they\\r\\ntreated the thief as he had treated them, and hoped, by a certain outward\\r\\nobservance and a few prayers, and by walking in a particular straight\\r\\nthough useless path from time to time, to save their souls. This may be to\\r\\njudge my neighbors harshly; for I believe that most of them are not aware\\r\\nthat they have such an institution as the jail in their village.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was formerly the custom in our village, when a poor debtor came out of\\r\\njail, for his acquaintances to salute him, looking through their fingers,\\r\\nwhich were crossed to represent the grating of a jail window, “How\\r\\ndo ye do?” My neighbors did not thus salute me, but first looked at\\r\\nme, and then at one another, as if I had returned from a long journey. I\\r\\nwas put into jail as I was going to the shoemaker’s to get a shoe\\r\\nwhich was mended. When I was let out the next morning, I proceeded to\\r\\nfinish my errand, and, having put on my mended shoe, joined a huckleberry\\r\\nparty, who were impatient to put themselves under my conduct; and in half\\r\\nan hour,—for the horse was soon tackled,—was in the midst of a\\r\\nhuckleberry field, on one of our highest hills, two miles off; and then\\r\\nthe State was nowhere to be seen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis is the whole history of “My Prisons.”\\n\\n\\r\\nI have never declined paying the highway tax, because I am as desirous of\\r\\nbeing a good neighbor as I am of being a bad subject; and, as for\\r\\nsupporting schools, I am doing my part to educate my fellow-countrymen\\r\\nnow. It is for no particular item in the tax-bill that I refuse to pay it.\\r\\nI simply wish to refuse allegiance to the State, to withdraw and stand\\r\\naloof from it effectually. I do not care to trace the course of my dollar,\\r\\nif I could, till it buys a man, or a musket to shoot one with,—the\\r\\ndollar is innocent,—but I am concerned to trace the effects of my\\r\\nallegiance. In fact, I quietly declare war with the State, after my\\r\\nfashion, though I will still make use and get what advantages of her I\\r\\ncan, as is usual in such cases.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIf others pay the tax which is demanded of me, from a sympathy with the\\r\\nState, they do but what they have already done in their own case, or\\r\\nrather they abet injustice to a greater extent than the State requires. If\\r\\nthey pay the tax from a mistaken interest in the individual taxed, to save\\r\\nhis property or prevent his going to jail, it is because they have not\\r\\nconsidered wisely how far they let their private feelings interfere with\\r\\nthe public good.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis, then, is my position at present. But one cannot be too much on his\\r\\nguard in such a case, lest his actions be biassed by obstinacy, or an undue\\r\\nregard for the opinions of men. Let him see that he does only what belongs\\r\\nto himself and to the hour.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI think sometimes, Why, this people mean well; they are only ignorant;\\r\\nthey would do better if they knew how: why give your neighbors this pain\\r\\nto treat you as they are not inclined to? But I think, again, this is no\\r\\nreason why I should do as they do, or permit others to suffer much greater\\r\\npain of a different kind. Again, I sometimes say to myself, When many\\r\\nmillions of men, without heat, without ill-will, without personal feeling\\r\\nof any kind, demand of you a few shillings only, without the possibility,\\r\\nsuch is their constitution, of retracting or altering their present\\r\\ndemand, and without the possibility, on your side, of appeal to any other\\r\\nmillions, why expose yourself to this overwhelming brute force? You do not\\r\\nresist cold and hunger, the winds and the waves, thus obstinately; you\\r\\nquietly submit to a thousand similar necessities. You do not put your head\\r\\ninto the fire. But just in proportion as I regard this as not wholly a\\r\\nbrute force, but partly a human force, and consider that I have relations\\r\\nto those millions as to so many millions of men, and not of mere brute or\\r\\ninanimate things, I see that appeal is possible, first and\\r\\ninstantaneously, from them to the Maker of them, and, secondly, from them\\r\\nto themselves. But, if I put my head deliberately into the fire, there is\\r\\nno appeal to fire or to the Maker of fire, and I have only myself to\\r\\nblame. If I could convince myself that I have any right to be satisfied\\r\\nwith men as they are, and to treat them accordingly, and not according, in\\r\\nsome respects, to my requisitions and expectations of what they and I\\r\\nought to be, then, like a good Mussulman and fatalist, I should endeavor\\r\\nto be satisfied with things as they are, and say it is the will of God.\\r\\nAnd, above all, there is this difference between resisting this and a\\r\\npurely brute or natural force, that I can resist this with some effect;\\r\\nbut I cannot expect, like Orpheus, to change the nature of the rocks and\\r\\ntrees and beasts.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI do not wish to quarrel with any man or nation. I do not wish to split\\r\\nhairs, to make fine distinctions, or set myself up as better than my\\r\\nneighbors. I seek rather, I may say, even an excuse for conforming to the\\r\\nlaws of the land. I am but too ready to conform to them. Indeed I have\\r\\nreason to suspect myself on this head; and each year, as the tax-gatherer\\r\\ncomes round, I find myself disposed to review the acts and position of the\\r\\ngeneral and state governments, and the spirit of the people to discover a\\r\\npretext for conformity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must affect our country as our parents,\\r\\nAnd if at any time we alienate\\r\\nOut love of industry from doing it honor,\\r\\nWe must respect effects and teach the soul\\r\\nMatter of conscience and religion,\\r\\nAnd not desire of rule or benefit.”\\n\\n\\r\\nI believe that the State will soon be able to take all my work of this\\r\\nsort out of my hands, and then I shall be no better patriot than my\\r\\nfellow-countrymen. Seen from a lower point of view, the Constitution, with\\r\\nall its faults, is very good; the law and the courts are very respectable;\\r\\neven this State and this American government are, in many respects, very\\r\\nadmirable, and rare things, to be thankful for, such as a great many have\\r\\ndescribed them; seen from a higher still, and the highest, who shall say\\r\\nwhat they are, or that they are worth looking at or thinking of at all?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHowever, the government does not concern me much, and I shall bestow the\\r\\nfewest possible thoughts on it. It is not many moments that I live under a\\r\\ngovernment, even in this world. If a man is thought-free, fancy-free,\\r\\nimagination-free, that which is not never for a long time appearing\\r\\nto be to him, unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatally interrupt\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI know that most men think differently from myself; but those whose lives\\r\\nare by profession devoted to the study of these or kindred subjects\\r\\ncontent me as little as any. Statesmen and legislators, standing so\\r\\ncompletely within the institution, never distinctly and nakedly behold it.\\r\\nThey speak of moving society, but have no resting-place without it. They\\r\\nmay be men of a certain experience and discrimination, and have no doubt\\r\\ninvented ingenious and even useful systems, for which we sincerely thank\\r\\nthem; but all their wit and usefulness lie within certain not very wide\\r\\nlimits. They are wont to forget that the world is not governed by policy\\r\\nand expediency. Webster never goes behind government, and so cannot speak\\r\\nwith authority about it. His words are wisdom to those legislators who\\r\\ncontemplate no essential reform in the existing government; but for\\r\\nthinkers, and those who legislate for all time, he never once glances at\\r\\nthe subject. I know of those whose serene and wise speculations on this\\r\\ntheme would soon reveal the limits of his mind’s range and\\r\\nhospitality. Yet, compared with the cheap professions of most reformers,\\r\\nand the still cheaper wisdom and eloquence of politicians in general, his\\r\\nare almost the only sensible and valuable words, and we thank Heaven for\\r\\nhim. Comparatively, he is always strong, original, and, above all,\\r\\npractical. Still his quality is not wisdom, but prudence. The\\r\\nlawyer’s truth is not Truth, but consistency or a consistent\\r\\nexpediency. Truth is always in harmony with herself, and is not concerned\\r\\nchiefly to reveal the justice that may consist with wrong-doing. He well\\r\\ndeserves to be called, as he has been called, the Defender of the\\r\\nConstitution. There are really no blows to be given by him but defensive\\r\\nones. He is not a leader, but a follower. His leaders are the men of\\r\\n’87. “I have never made an effort,” he says, “and\\r\\nnever propose to make an effort; I have never countenanced an effort, and\\r\\nnever mean to countenance an effort, to disturb the arrangement as\\r\\noriginally made, by which the various States came into the Union.”\\r\\nStill thinking of the sanction which the Constitution gives to slavery, he\\r\\nsays, “Because it was part of the original compact,—let it\\r\\nstand.” Notwithstanding his special acuteness and ability, he is\\r\\nunable to take a fact out of its merely political relations, and behold it\\r\\nas it lies absolutely to be disposed of by the intellect,—what, for\\r\\ninstance, it behoves a man to do here in America today with regard to\\r\\nslavery, but ventures, or is driven, to make some such desperate answer as\\r\\nthe following, while professing to speak absolutely, and as a private\\r\\nman,—from which what new and singular code of social duties might be\\r\\ninferred?—“The manner,” says he, “in which the\\r\\ngovernments of those States where slavery exists are to regulate it, is\\r\\nfor their own consideration, under the responsibility to their\\r\\nconstituents, to the general laws of propriety, humanity, and justice, and\\r\\nto God. Associations formed elsewhere, springing from a feeling of\\r\\nhumanity, or any other cause, have nothing whatever to do with it. They\\r\\nhave never received any encouragement from me and they never will.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey who know of no purer sources of truth, who have traced up its stream\\r\\nno higher, stand, and wisely stand, by the Bible and the Constitution, and\\r\\ndrink at it there with reverence and humanity; but they who behold where\\r\\nit comes trickling into this lake or that pool, gird up their loins once\\r\\nmore, and continue their pilgrimage toward its fountain-head.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNo man with a genius for legislation has appeared in America. They are\\r\\nrare in the history of the world. There are orators, politicians, and\\r\\neloquent men, by the thousand; but the speaker has not yet opened his\\r\\nmouth to speak who is capable of settling the much-vexed questions of the\\r\\nday. We love eloquence for its own sake, and not for any truth which it\\r\\nmay utter, or any heroism it may inspire. Our legislators have not yet\\r\\nlearned the comparative value of free-trade and of freedom, of union, and\\r\\nof rectitude, to a nation. They have no genius or talent for comparatively\\r\\nhumble questions of taxation and finance, commerce and manufactures and\\r\\nagriculture. If we were left solely to the wordy wit of legislators in\\r\\nCongress for our guidance, uncorrected by the seasonable experience and\\r\\nthe effectual complaints of the people, America would not long retain her\\r\\nrank among the nations. For eighteen hundred years, though perchance I\\r\\nhave no right to say it, the New Testament has been written; yet where is\\r\\nthe legislator who has wisdom and practical talent enough to avail himself\\r\\nof the light which it sheds on the science of legislation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe authority of government, even such as I am willing to submit\\r\\nto,—for I will cheerfully obey those who know and can do better than\\r\\nI, and in many things even those who neither know nor can do so\\r\\nwell,—is still an impure one: to be strictly just, it must have the\\r\\nsanction and consent of the governed. It can have no pure right over my\\r\\nperson and property but what I concede to it. The progress from an\\r\\nabsolute to a limited monarchy, from a limited monarchy to a democracy, is\\r\\na progress toward a true respect for the individual. Even the Chinese\\r\\nphilosopher was wise enough to regard the individual as the basis of the\\r\\nempire. Is a democracy, such as we know it, the last improvement possible\\r\\nin government? Is it not possible to take a step further towards\\r\\nrecognizing and organizing the rights of man? There will never be a really\\r\\nfree and enlightened State, until the State comes to recognize the\\r\\nindividual as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power\\r\\nand authority are derived, and treats him accordingly. I please myself\\r\\nwith imagining a State at last which can afford to be just to all men, and\\r\\nto treat the individual with respect as a neighbor; which even would not\\r\\nthink it inconsistent with its own repose, if a few were to live aloof from\\r\\nit, not meddling with it, nor embraced by it, who fulfilled all the duties\\r\\nof neighbors and fellow-men. A State which bore this kind of fruit, and\\r\\nsuffered it to drop off as fast as it ripened, would prepare the way for a\\r\\nstill more perfect and glorious State, which also I have imagined, but not\\r\\nyet anywhere seen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of The Project Gutenberg Etext of Walden, and On The Duty Of Civil\\r\\nDisobedience, by Henry David Thoreau\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WALDEN ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 205-h.htm or 205-h.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/2/0/205/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Judith Boss, and David Widger\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\r\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\r\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\r\\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\r\\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\\r\\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\\r\\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and\\r\\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
